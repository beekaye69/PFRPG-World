## 📖 CORE MAGIC MECHANICS (From PFRPG Rulebook)

### Combat Magic vs Free-Form Magic

**Combat Magic:**
- Location: Used during combat encounters
- Limit: 2 spells per encounter (total)
- Action: Casting takes a combat action
- Types: Can cast same spell twice OR two different spells
- Expansion: Heroic Reroll allows +1 additional spell per encounter
- Range: Per spell description
- Examples: Dark Bolt, Rain of Fire, Confusion, Summon Monster, Arcane Armor, Aid from Beyond

**Free-Form Magic:**
- Location: Used outside of combat only
- Limit: 2 spells per session (total)
- Action: Casting uses task resolution system
- Types: Any creative magic (food creation, levitation, etc.)
- Expansion: Heroic Reroll allows +1 additional spell per session
- Duration: Conjured items last 24 hours
- Examples: Conjure food, create boat, create rope, levitate, speak with animals, detect secret doors

### Key Difference: Predictability

**Combat Spells:** Defined mechanics, known effects, roll-based execution

**Free-Form Spells:** Creative within boundaries, PM discretion on success/failure, based on task difficulty

## 🔥 COMPLETE SPELL ANALYSIS

### SPELL #1: DARK BOLT

**Official Mechanics (From Rulebook):**
- Type: Ranged Attack Action
- Damage: CS d6
- Reroll: Roll twice, take best result
- Special: May explode (if natural 6, roll again and add)
- Target: Single enemy at range
- Action Cost: 1 combat action

**What Dark Bolt Is:**
Single-target burst damage spell with exploding potential. Best against one strong enemy or when you need guaranteed damage.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Guaranteed single-target damage
- ✅ Explosion potential for massive damage
- ✅ Reroll means better average damage
- ✅ Works at any range (weapon range)
- ✅ Can solve "tough single enemy" encounters

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Only hits one target
- ❌ Useless against multiple enemies
- ❌ Takes a spell slot (2 max per encounter)
- ❌ Can fail if rolls low (d6 range: 1-6)
- ❌ Target gets Defence roll after

**When to Use Dark Bolt:**
- ✓ Single strong enemy (Troll, Ogre, Boss)
- ✓ Need focused damage on key target
- ✓ Multiple weak enemies (one per turn strategy)
- ✓ When Rain of Fire won't work (enemies spread out)

**When NOT to Use Dark Bolt:**
- ✗ Multiple enemies close together (use Rain of Fire instead)
- ✗ Crowd control needed (use Confusion instead)
- ✗ Need ally summon (use Summon Monster instead)
- ✗ Want to prevent attack (use Arcane Armor instead)

---

#### DARK BOLT EXAMPLE 1: Single Strong Enemy

**Setup:**
- Wizard at 4/4 HP (full health)
- Enemy: Ogre (CS d6, 12 HP)
- Party: Just Wizard and one Fighter
- Fighter is fighting Ogre already, Ogre is winning

**Situation:**
Wizard needs to contribute damage. Fighter is taking 4+ damage per round. Wizard has 2 spell slots this encounter.

**Decision:**
Cast Dark Bolt on Ogre. (Saving second spell for possible emergency healing from items or future turns.)

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Dark Bolt at the Ogre!"
- PM: "Roll your CS d6 for the damage."
- Wizard rolls: First d6 = 4
- "I also rolled, so you reroll. Second roll = 5. Take the best: 5 damage."
- Ogre Defence: Rolls d6 = 3
- Ogre takes: 5 - 3 = 2 damage
- Ogre HP: 12 - 2 = 10/12

**Analysis:**
Good hit (5 damage before Defence). Ogre damaged but still strong. Wizard contributed meaningful damage.

**Outcome:** Fighter continues melee while Ogre is weakened. Combat continues next round.

---

#### DARK BOLT EXAMPLE 2: Exploding Dark Bolt

**Setup:**
- Same encounter: Wizard vs Ogre
- Wizard has used 1 of 2 spells already
- Ogre at 6/12 HP (half health, getting desperate)
- Fighter at 3/10 HP (hurt)

**Situation:**
Wizard has ONE spell slot remaining. Ogre is close to becoming dangerous. Need to finish it or control it.

**Decision:**
Cast Dark Bolt again, hoping for explosion to eliminate Ogre.

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Dark Bolt again!"
- PM: "Roll your CS d6."
- Wizard rolls first d6: Natural 6! 
- "You get to explode! Roll again."
- Wizard rolls second d6: 4
- Total damage: 6 + 4 = 10 damage
- Ogre Defence: Rolls d6 = 2
- Ogre takes: 10 - 2 = 8 damage
- Ogre HP: 6 - 8 = 0 (DEAD!)

**Analysis:**
Explosion triggered (natural 6). Second roll was 4. Combined = 10 before defence (likely kills average Ogre).

**Outcome:** Ogre defeated! Wizard's two spell slots eliminated the threat.

---

#### DARK BOLT EXAMPLE 3: Dark Bolt vs Rain of Fire Decision

**Setup:**
- Wizard encounters 3 Goblins spread out (not adjacent)
- Goblins are: CS d6-3, 2 HP each
- Wizard has 2 spell slots

**Question:** Dark Bolt vs Rain of Fire?

**Dark Bolt Strategy:**
- Cost: 1 spell per goblin
- Damage: CS d6 reroll, average ~3-4 before defence
- Result: Kills 1-2 goblins with both spells
- Problem: 3 goblins left if unlucky

**Rain of Fire Strategy:**
- Cost: 1 spell for up to 4 enemies
- Damage: CS d6-1 reroll, average ~2-3 each before defence
- Result: Hits all 3 goblins with 1 spell
- Benefit: Saves spell slot, covers all enemies

**Recommendation:** Use Rain of Fire (better for spread-out group)

---

### SPELL #2: RAIN OF FIRE

**Official Mechanics (From Rulebook):**
- Type: Area Ranged Attack Action
- Targets: Up to 4 targets in close proximity (PM discretion)
- Damage per target: CS d6-1
- Reroll: Roll twice, take best result
- Action Cost: 1 combat action
- Special: Exceptional for group encounters

**What Rain of Fire Is:**
Area-of-effect damage spell. Hits multiple enemies at once with same damage roll. Best against groups of weaker enemies.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Hits up to 4 enemies with ONE spell
- ✅ Single damage roll hits all (efficient)
- ✅ Reroll means consistent damage
- ✅ Best crowd control via damage
- ✅ Often kills weak enemies instantly

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Enemies must be close together
- ❌ Slightly lower damage (d6-1 vs d6)
- ❌ Takes a spell slot
- ❌ Each target gets Defence roll
- ❌ Doesn't control strong enemies

**When to Use Rain of Fire:**
- ✓ Multiple enemies close together (Goblin pack, etc.)
- ✓ Want to eliminate many weak enemies at once
- ✓ Need to control positioning (area denial)
- ✓ Save spell slots (1 spell = 4 targets)
- ✓ Softening up groups before melee

**When NOT to Use Rain of Fire:**
- ✗ Single strong enemy (waste, use Dark Bolt)
- ✗ Enemies spread far apart (can't hit all)
- ✗ Need to prevent attacks (use Confusion or Arcane Armor)
- ✗ Need ally summon (use Summon Monster)

---

#### RAIN OF FIRE EXAMPLE 1: Goblin Pack Elimination

**Setup:**
- Wizard encounters 4 Goblins in tavern brawl
- Goblins: CS d6-3, 2 HP each
- Goblins are clustered (close together)
- Wizard has 2 spell slots

**Situation:**
Four weak enemies, all in one area. Perfect Rain of Fire scenario.

**Decision:**
Cast Rain of Fire on the Goblin cluster.

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Rain of Fire on the goblin group!"
- PM: "Roll your CS d6-1."
- Wizard rolls first d6: 5, minus 1 = 4 damage
- PM: "Reroll?"
- Wizard rolls second d6: 3, minus 1 = 2 damage
- Wizard: "I take the best: 4 damage to all goblins."
- PM: "All four goblins in close proximity take 4 damage. They each get a Defence roll."
- Goblin 1 Defence: d6-3 = rolls 2, -3 = 0 (can't go below 0) → takes 4 damage
- Goblin 2 Defence: d6-3 = rolls 1, -3 = 0 → takes 4 damage
- Goblin 3 Defence: d6-3 = rolls 3, -3 = 0 → takes 4 damage
- Goblin 4 Defence: d6-3 = rolls 2, -3 = 0 → takes 4 damage
- PM: "All four goblins had 2 HP. They're all dead."

**Analysis:**
One spell eliminated four enemies instantly. Extremely efficient.

**Outcome:** Tavern brawl over before it really starts. Wizard used 1 of 2 spells.

---

#### RAIN OF FIRE EXAMPLE 2: Partial Group Hit

**Setup:**
- Wizard vs Mixed Encounter (2 Goblins + 1 Orc)
- Goblins: 2 HP each
- Orc: 8 HP
- Goblins adjacent, Orc is 20 feet away (out of Rain of Fire range)

**Situation:**
Rain of Fire can hit both Goblins but NOT the Orc (too far). Is it worth it?

**Decision:**
Use Rain of Fire on the Goblins (nearby), leave Orc for Dark Bolt or later.

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "Rain of Fire on the two Goblins!"
- PM: "They're close together. Roll CS d6-1."
- Wizard rolls: 5, minus 1 = 4 damage
- Reroll: 2, minus 1 = 1 damage
- Best: 4 damage to both Goblins
- Both Goblins dead (2 HP each)
- Orc untouched (out of range)

**Analysis:**
Used 1 spell to eliminate 2 enemies. Orc remains at 8/8 HP but is now alone. Wizard has 1 spell left.

**Outcome:** Goblins eliminated. Now 1v1 Wizard vs Orc (disadvantageous, but possible to finish with Dark Bolt or items).

---

#### RAIN OF FIRE EXAMPLE 3: Rain of Fire vs Confusion

**Setup:**
- Wizard vs 4 enemy group
- Mix: 2 Goblins (2 HP each) + 2 Skeletons (4 HP each)
- All clustered together
- Wizard has 2 spell slots

**Question:** Rain of Fire (damage) or Confusion (control)?

**Rain of Fire:**
- Cost: 1 spell
- Effect: CS d6-1 to all 4 enemies
- Expected: Kill Goblins (2 HP), wound Skeletons (4 HP)
- Remaining: 2 wounded Skeletons continue attacking

**Confusion:**
- Cost: 1 spell
- Effect: All enemies frozen for 3 rounds (can't move/attack)
- Expected: All 4 enemies stunned, party controls next 3 rounds
- Benefit: Time to reposition, cast other spell, etc.

**Recommendation:** Depends on party health!
- If party healthy: Use Rain of Fire (eliminate threats)
- If party hurt: Use Confusion (prevent damage for 3 rounds)

---

### SPELL #3: CONFUSION

**Official Mechanics (From Rulebook):**
- Type: Crowd Control
- Effect: Enemies can't move or make Attack Actions (3 rounds)
- Still can use Defence Actions (still block damage)
- Success Condition: Each affected enemy makes tough task roll
- Failure: Affected enemy stays confused for duration
- Action Cost: 1 combat action
- Reroll: Spell duration rolled as d6-3 (minimum 1 round)

**What Confusion Is:**
Powerful crowd control spell. Stops enemies from attacking or moving for duration. Best against dangerous enemy groups.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Stops ALL enemies from attacking (if they fail roll)
- ✅ Prevents movement entirely
- ✅ Lets party control next rounds
- ✅ Stacks with damage spells
- ✅ Excellent for saving party from wipeout

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Enemies can still Defence (block damage)
- ❌ Enemies get tough task roll (often succeed)
- ❌ Only works 3 rounds max (usually)
- ❌ Undead immune (important limitation)
- ❌ Takes a spell slot

**When to Use Confusion:**
- ✓ Party is losing (prevent damage while regrouping)
- ✓ Enemy group is dangerous (stop attacks)
- ✓ Need time (3 rounds to reposition/heal)
- ✓ Before casting other spells (set up Rain of Fire)
- ✓ Against non-undead groups

**When NOT to Use Confusion:**
- ✗ Undead enemies (they're immune!)
- ✗ Single enemy (waste of spell)
- ✗ Can kill enemies instead (use damage spells)
- ✗ Enemies already losing (overkill)

---

#### CONFUSION EXAMPLE 1: Desperate Defense

**Setup:**
- Party: Fighter (2/10 HP), Cleric (1/8 HP), Wizard (4/4 HP)
- Enemies: 3 Orcs (CS d6, 5 HP each)
- Combat has been brutal
- Fighter is about to die

**Situation:**
Party losing badly. Orcs will kill Fighter next round. Need to stop attacks immediately.

**Decision:**
Cast Confusion to freeze enemies for 3 rounds. Buy time to heal/reposition.

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Confusion on the Orc group!"
- PM: "All three Orcs make tough task rolls."
- Orc 1: Rolls 4 (failure, confused!)
- Orc 2: Rolls 5 (success, not confused)
- Orc 3: Rolls 3 (failure, confused!)
- Result: 2 of 3 Orcs confused for 3 rounds, 1 still attacking

**Analysis:**
Confusion reduced enemy attacks by 2/3. Party survives round. Can now heal or cast Confuse again on the remaining Orc.

**Outcome:** Party gets breathing room. Fighter can be healed, Cleric can use Holy Light. Wizard still has 1 spell slot left.

---

#### CONFUSION EXAMPLE 2: Undead Immunity Trap

**Setup:**
- Party encounters: 4 Skeletons (undead)
- Party in trouble (low HP)
- Wizard wants to use Confusion

**Situation:**
Wizard casts Confusion, thinking it will freeze undead.

**PM's Response:**
"Undead are immune to Confusion. The skeletons ignore the spell and continue attacking."

**Analysis:**
Confusion wasted (spell slot used, no effect). Party now has 1 spell left instead of 2.

**Lesson:** Always check if enemies are undead before casting Confusion!

---

#### CONFUSION EXAMPLE 3: Confusion into Rain of Fire Combo

**Setup:**
- Party encounters 5 Goblins (clustered, not undead)
- Party wants to eliminate all efficiently
- Wizard has 2 spells

**Strategy:**
Round 1: Cast Confusion
Rounds 2-3: Enemies frozen
Round 4+: Cast Rain of Fire on frozen goblins

**Execution (Round 1):**
- Wizard: "I cast Confusion on the Goblin group!"
- PM: "Five Goblins make tough rolls."
- Result: 4 fail (confused), 1 succeeds (still acting)
- Confused Goblins can't move or attack (can still Defence)

**Execution (Round 2):**
- Remaining Orc attacks, others just sit there
- Party attacks confused Goblins freely

**Execution (Round 3):**
- Still confused, still defenseless

**Execution (Round 4):**
- Confused Goblins snap out of confusion
- Wizard: "I cast Rain of Fire!"
- Hits all remaining Goblins
- Most die

**Analysis:**
By combining spells, Wizard controlled entire encounter. Confusion immobilized group, Rain of Fire cleaned up.

**Outcome:** All Goblins eliminated by end of Round 4.

---

### SPELL #4: SUMMON MONSTER

**Official Mechanics (From Rulebook):**
- Type: Summons an ally under caster's control
- Duration: Roll d6-2 (minimum 2 rounds total)
- Control: Doesn't take up caster's action (PM discretion)
- Movement: Summon appears adjacent to caster
- Can Attack: Summons can attack on caster's initiative
- Actions: Follows caster's orders
- Monster Type: Random d6 roll determines type

**Monster Summoning Table:**
```
Roll 1-4: Choose Goblin OR Giant Centipede
Roll 5-6: Add Orc, Skeleton, Wolf, or Giant Spider to choices

If roll 6, re-roll:
  On another 6: Can add Minotaur, Ogre, or Troll to choices
```

**Summoned Monsters Stats:**
- Goblin: Weak (CS d6-3, ~3 HP)
- Giant Centipede: Weak (CS d6-3, ~4 HP)
- Orc: Average (CS d6-2, ~5 HP)
- Skeleton: Average (CS d6-2, ~4 HP) [Undead]
- Wolf: Average (CS d6-2, ~4 HP)
- Giant Spider: Average (CS d6-2, ~5 HP)
- Minotaur: Tough (CS d6-1, ~8 HP) [Rare]
- Ogre: Tough (CS d6-1, ~10 HP) [Rare]
- Troll: Powerful (CS d6, ~12 HP) [Very Rare, with Regenerate]

**What Summon Monster Is:**
Creates a temporary ally that fights for the caster. Scales from weak Goblins to powerful Trolls. Best for extending party numbers and tanking.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Creates ally to fight with you
- ✅ Monsters can take hits meant for you
- ✅ Adds DPS to party
- ✅ Can summon strong monsters (Ogre, Minotaur)
- ✅ Lasts 2-6 rounds (decent duration)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Duration is random (d6-2)
- ❌ Monster type is random (might get weak Goblin)
- ❌ Takes a spell slot
- ❌ Monster follows caster's will (might not prioritize optimally)
- ❌ Summoned monster has limited HP

**When to Use Summon Monster:**
- ✓ Party is outnumbered (add extra combatant)
- ✓ Need a tank (monster absorbs damage)
- ✓ Want flexible control (order monster around)
- ✓ Have bad RNG with other spells
- ✓ Single strong enemy fight (summon is backup)

**When NOT to Use Summon Monster:**
- ✗ Already winning combat (waste)
- ✗ Need immediate damage (damage spells better)
- ✗ Summoned monster is too weak (unlucky roll)
- ✗ Group is already optimal (no room for ally)

---

#### SUMMON MONSTER EXAMPLE 1: Goblin Summoning

**Setup:**
- Party: Fighter + Wizard only (2 people vs 4 Goblins)
- Heavily outnumbered
- Wizard has 2 spell slots

**Situation:**
Fighting 4 Goblins with just Fighter (melee) + Wizard (spellcaster). Need extra combatant.

**Decision:**
Cast Summon Monster to add ally.

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Summon Monster!"
- PM: "Roll d6 to determine duration and then type."
- Wizard rolls for duration: d6 = 5, minus 2 = 3 rounds (3 round summoning)
- Wizard rolls for type: d6 = 2 (can only choose Goblin or Giant Centipede)
- Wizard: "I summon a Goblin!"
- PM: "A Goblin appears next to you, under your control."

**Goblin Stats:**
- CS: d6-3
- HP: ~3
- Melee: d6-3 attacks (weak)
- Effect: Better than nothing, but still weak

**Analysis:**
Summoned Goblin is weak (CS d6-3, same as wild Goblins). But it adds body to party. Now 3 vs 4 instead of 2 vs 4. Slightly better odds.

**Combat Flow:**
- Round 1: Goblin appears, attacks weakest enemy (following wizard's order)
- Round 2: Goblin continues fighting
- Round 3: Goblin continues fighting
- Round 4: Goblin vanishes (3 round duration ended)

**Outcome:** Goblin helped even odds for 3 rounds. Party survived long enough to defeat remaining enemies.

---

#### SUMMON MONSTER EXAMPLE 2: Orc Summoning (Better Roll)

**Setup:**
- Same encounter: Party vs 4 Goblins
- Wizard rolls better for summon

**Decision:**
Cast Summon Monster (hoping for better monster)

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Summon Monster!"
- Duration roll: d6 = 4, minus 2 = 2 rounds
- Type roll: d6 = 5 (now can choose Orc, Skeleton, Wolf, or Giant Spider!)
- Wizard: "I summon an Orc!"
- PM: "A 6-foot-tall Orc appears next to you."

**Orc Stats:**
- CS: d6-2 (better than Goblin)
- HP: ~5 (more durable)
- Melee: More dangerous to enemies
- Effect: Actually useful combat asset

**Analysis:**
Orc is stronger than Goblin. Better attacks (d6-2), more HP. Significantly more valuable.

**Combat Flow:**
- Round 1: Orc appears, attacks (decent damage)
- Round 2: Orc attacks (Wizard's control)
- Round 3: Orc vanishes
- But 2 rounds of good damage/tanking significant

**Outcome:** Stronger ally helped party win. Better RNG roll = better combat outcome.

---

#### SUMMON MONSTER EXAMPLE 3: Minotaur (Lucky Double Roll)

**Setup:**
- Party vs 1 strong enemy (Troll, 20 HP, CS d6)
- Wizard wants strongest possible summon
- Wizard gets lucky

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Summon Monster!"
- Duration: d6 = 6, minus 2 = 4 rounds
- Type: d6 = 6! (re-roll time!)
- Re-roll: d6 = 6! (double sixes!)
- Wizard: "I summon a Minotaur!"
- PM: "A massive bull-creature appears!"

**Minotaur Stats:**
- CS: d6-1 (powerful)
- HP: ~8 (decent durability)
- Effect: Serious combat asset

**Analysis:**
Super lucky roll (6 then 6 again). Minotaur is strong enough to contribute real damage to Troll fight. Duration of 4 rounds is long enough.

**Combat:**
- Minotaur + Fighter vs Troll
- Minotaur deals d6-1 damage per round
- Troll now facing 2 melee combatants
- Odds shift significantly in party's favor

**Outcome:** Lucky summoning creates advantage. Sometimes RNG smiles on you!

---

### SPELL #5: ARCANE ARMOR

**Official Mechanics (From Rulebook):**
- Type: Buff/Defense spell
- Effect: Target makes all Defence Actions at CS d6 (for duration)
- Reroll: Roll twice and take the best result
- Duration: Entire encounter
- Target: One character (self or ally)
- Action Cost: 1 combat action

**What Arcane Armor Is:**
Enhances Defence rolls for one character. Makes them much harder to hit. Best when a key ally is under heavy attack.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Boosts Defence significantly (everyone gets CS d6)
- ✅ Works entire encounter (one-time cast)
- ✅ Can be cast on Fighter (tank) or vulnerable ally
- ✅ Reroll means consistent Defence
- ✅ Stacks with actual armor

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Only affects one person
- ❌ Takes a spell slot
- ❌ Doesn't prevent damage (just reduces it)
- ❌ Requires choosing good target
- ❌ Limited benefit if target already good at Defence

**When to Use Arcane Armor:**
- ✓ Fighter is taking heavy damage (boost tanking)
- ✓ Squishy ally needs protection (Cleric, Wizard)
- ✓ Want to ensure ally survival
- ✓ Party has one key person (protect that person)
- ✓ Encounter will last many rounds (long benefit)

**When NOT to Use Arcane Armor:**
- ✗ Already winning easily (overkill)
- ✗ Need damage instead (use Dark Bolt)
- ✗ Need crowd control (use Confusion)
- ✗ Need healing (other spells better)
- ✗ Target already has good Defence

---

#### ARCANE ARMOR EXAMPLE 1: Fighter Protection

**Setup:**
- Fighter is getting pounded (2/10 HP)
- Enemy is strong (CS d6, consistent 3-4 damage)
- Wizard hasn't used spells yet
- Needs to keep Fighter alive

**Situation:**
Fighter will die in 1-2 more hits. Need to increase Fighter's Defence.

**Decision:**
Cast Arcane Armor on Fighter.

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Arcane Armor on the Fighter!"
- Fighter: "From now on, my Defence rolls are CS d6 (instead of d6)!"
- Effect: Fighter now rolls d6 for Defence (reroll twice, take best)

**Impact:**
- Fighter Defence rolls went from d6 (average 3.5) to d6 (same)
- But wait, Fighter's CS is d6 normally! What's the difference?
- Difference: Fighter already rolls d6. But the reroll mechanic means TWO d6 rolls taking best.
- New: Fighter rolls d6, then rolls d6 again, takes best = average 4.5 instead of 3.5

**Analysis:**
Average Defence increased from 3.5 to 4.5 (roughly +1). Against 3-4 damage attacks, this might fully block one hit per encounter.

**Combat:**
- Next round enemy attacks
- Fighter Defence (new): Rolls 4, re-rolls, gets 5, takes 5
- Enemy damage: 4
- Fighter blocked: 5 (blocks all!)
- Fighter survives

**Outcome:** Arcane Armor enabled Fighter survival. Second spell still available if needed.

---

#### ARCANE ARMOR EXAMPLE 2: Wizard Self-Cast

**Setup:**
- Wizard at 4/4 HP (one hit from death)
- Combat ongoing
- Enemies are ranged attackers (targeting Wizard)

**Situation:**
Wizard will die from ranged attacks. Need protection immediately.

**Decision:**
Cast Arcane Armor on self.

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Arcane Armor on myself!"
- Effect: Wizard's Defence now CS d6 (reroll twice, take best)
- Normally Wizard defence would be... actually Wizard CS d6-2 (bad!)
- With Arcane Armor: Wizard gets CS d6 (d6-2 becomes d6, massive boost!)

**Impact:**
- Wizard Defence jumped from d6-2 (average 2.5) to d6 (average 4.5)
- That's a +2 average improvement
- Against 2-3 damage attacks, likely blocks most hits

**Combat:**
- Ranged attacker rolls: 4 damage
- Wizard Defence (new): Rolls 5, re-rolls, gets 6, takes 6
- Wizard blocks: 6 (all damage blocked!)
- Wizard survives

**Outcome:** Self-cast Arcane Armor saved Wizard's life. One more survivable hit.

---

### SPELL #6: AID FROM BEYOND

**Official Mechanics (From Rulebook):**
- Type: Party support/buff spell
- Effect: Other characters in party receive Heroic Reroll
- Duration: For use only during current encounter
- Action Cost: 1 combat action
- Special: Can only be used once per encounter normally
- Reroll: One additional use if Wizard uses Heroic Reroll

**What Aid from Beyond Is:**
Grants temporary Heroic Rerolls to allies. Best when party needs to succeed on crucial rolls.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Helps entire party (multiple people can benefit)
- ✅ Heroic Rerolls are valuable (let allies retry failed rolls)
- ✅ Can swing tight encounters
- ✅ Works with all party members
- ✅ Party can use Rerolls for anything (attack, Defence, spells, tasks)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Only gives reroll (doesn't guarantee success)
- ❌ Party might waste rerolls (use on non-critical)
- ❌ Takes a spell slot
- ❌ Allies must use rerolls optimally
- ❌ Requires good party communication

**When to Use Aid from Beyond:**
- ✓ Party needs lucky rolls to win (give them chances)
- ✓ Important attack/Defence is coming up (prepare)
- ✓ Party doesn't have many Heroic Rerolls left
- ✓ Multiple allies at critical HP (each might need reroll)
- ✓ Single spell slot can help whole party

**When NOT to Use Aid from Beyond:**
- ✗ Already winning (overkill)
- ✗ Party has plenty of Heroic Rerolls (waste)
- ✗ Need damage instead (damage spells more direct)
- ✗ Allies won't use rerolls well (bad coordination)

---

#### AID FROM BEYOND EXAMPLE 1: Party Reroll Support

**Setup:**
- Party: Fighter (5/10 HP), Cleric (3/8 HP), Wizard (4/4 HP)
- Enemy: Boss Ogre (20 HP, strong)
- Party has 0 Heroic Rerolls left (all used)
- Boss is at 8/20 HP (close but not dead)

**Situation:**
Party is close to victory but out of Heroic Rerolls. Crucial rolls coming up. Fighter needs to land a high attack this turn.

**Decision:**
Cast Aid from Beyond to give party Heroic Reroll.

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Aid from Beyond!"
- PM: "All party members each gain a Heroic Reroll for this encounter."
- Fighter gets a Heroic Reroll
- Cleric gets a Heroic Reroll

**Next Round Combat:**
- Fighter attacks Ogre: Rolls 2 (bad!)
- Fighter: "I use my Heroic Reroll from Aid from Beyond!"
- Fighter rerolls: Rolls 5 (good!)
- Fighter Attack: 5 damage (real damage this time)
- Ogre Defence: Rolls 1, takes 4 damage
- Ogre HP: 8 - 4 = 4/20

**Analysis:**
Aid from Beyond enabled Fighter to succeed. Without reroll, attack would have dealt 0 damage (d6-2 becomes 2, Ogre blocks 4). With reroll, Fighter dealt 4 damage.

**Outcome:** Party closes in on victory with Heroic Reroll help.

---

#### AID FROM BEYOND EXAMPLE 2: Critical Moment Timing

**Setup:**
- Same Boss fight
- Ogre at 4/20 HP (very close to death)
- Party is about to make final push
- Wizard has 1 spell left, 1 damage spell available (Dark Bolt)

**Dilemma:**
Use Dark Bolt to finish Ogre? Or use Aid from Beyond to help party finish?

**Analysis:**
- Dark Bolt: Guaranteed d6 damage (average 3.5, might kill)
- Aid from Beyond: Gives party rerolls, they might succeed better

**Fighter's Health Matters:**
- Fighter at 5/10 HP
- If Fighter misses this attack (low roll), Ogre might survive 3 more rounds
- But if Fighter rerolls and succeeds, Ogre dies next round

**Decision:**
Use Aid from Beyond (not Dark Bolt). Let Fighter use reroll to make crucial attack.

**Execution:**
- Wizard: "I cast Aid from Beyond!"
- Fighter gets Heroic Reroll
- Fighter attacks: Rolls 2
- Fighter: "Reroll!"
- Fighter rerolls: Rolls 5
- Fighter Attack: 5 damage
- Ogre takes 4 damage (5 - 1 Defence)
- Ogre HP: 4 - 4 = 0/20 (DEAD!)

**Outcome:** Aid from Beyond won the battle more efficiently than direct damage would have.

## 📊 SPELL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

**Key Mechanic:** 2 Spells Per Encounter

You have exactly 2 spell slots per encounter. You must choose:
- Option A: Use both on same spell type (2x Dark Bolt)
- Option B: Split between different spells (Dark Bolt + Confusion)
- Option C: Use 1 spell, save 1 (hedge bet)

**Resource Management Examples:**

### Scenario 1: Known Strong Enemy (Troll)
```
Expected: Single boss fight
Strategy: Save both spells for single enemy
  Spell 1: Dark Bolt (opening damage)
  Spell 2: Dark Bolt (finish attempt)
Risk: If Troll has friends, second spell wastes
```

### Scenario 2: Unknown Encounter
```
Expected: Unknown enemy type
Strategy: Hedge with flexibility
  Spell 1: Summon Monster (adds combatant, see what's coming)
  Spell 2: Save for response (damage, control, or buff)
Risk: Summoned monster might be weak, wastes spell slot
```

### Scenario 3: Dangerous Situation
```
Expected: Party losing, enemies strong
Strategy: Control first, damage second
  Spell 1: Confusion (stop enemy attacks)
  Spell 2: Damage spell if party survives confusion
Risk: Confusion might fail (tough task rolls)
```

### Scenario 4: Optimization Play
```
Expected: Multiple weak enemies
Strategy: Maximize efficiency
  Spell 1: Rain of Fire (kill multiple)
  Spell 2: Save or use on stragglers
Risk: Enemies spread apart, Rain of Fire misses
```

## 🌟 FREE-FORM MAGIC (Out of Combat)

**What It Is:**
Creative magic cast outside of combat. Unlimited possibilities. Uses task resolution.

**Mechanics:**
- Location: Out of combat only
- Limit: 2 per session
- Action: Task roll based on complexity/duration/scope
- Success: PM determines if spell works
- Failure: Spell attempt is lost
- Duration: Usually 24 hours if conjured

**Classic Examples (From Rulebook):**
- Conjure food
- Create boat
- Create rope
- Create bridge (over lava)
- Levitate (to top of tower)
- Speak with animals
- Detect secret doors
- Send telepathic message
- Breathe underwater

**PM Adjudication:**
PM decides success/failure based on:
1. **Complexity:** Simple (laughable) vs Complex (very difficult)
2. **Duration:** How long does it last? (24 hours standard)
3. **Scope:** How big? How many people affected?

**Decision Framework:**

| Spell | Complexity | Duration | Scope | Example Difficulty |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Conjure food | Laughable | 24 hrs | 6 portions | Guaranteed success |
| Create rope | Simple | Permanent | 50ft rope | Simple task |
| Create boat | Average | 24 hrs | Boat for 6 | Average task |
| Bridge over lava | Tough | 24 hrs | 50ft span | Tough task |
| Levitate to tower | Tough | 1 hour | Self only | Tough task |
| Speak with animals | Average | 1 hour | One animal | Average task |
| Detect secret doors | Simple | Instant | Current room | Simple task |
| Telepathic message | Average | 1 minute | Long distance | Average task |
| Breathe underwater | Average | 4 hours | Self only | Average task |
