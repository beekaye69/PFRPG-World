## CORE MECHANICS OVERVIEW

**Glossary References:** See PFRPG-Glossary.md for detailed definitions of all terms used in this section.

### Task Resolution System

The fundamental mechanic for all non-combat actions uses a single d6 roll against difficulty thresholds. The Pocket Master (PM) sets task difficulty based on circumstances, and characters attempt to meet or exceed the success threshold.

#### Task Difficulty Tiers

| Difficulty | Fail Roll | Success Roll | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Laughable** | 1 | 2+ | Trivial tasks, nearly impossible to fail |
| **Simple** | 1-2 | 3+ | Basic competency required |
| **Average** | 1-3 | 4+ | Standard difficulty, requires attention |
| **Tough** | 1-4 | 5+ | Challenging, most people would struggle |
| **Very Difficult** | 1-5 | 6 | Nearly impossible, only natural success counts |

*Glossary Terms: [Task Roll](PFRPG-Glossary.md#task-roll), [d6](PFRPG-Glossary.md#d6), [Laughable](PFRPG-Glossary.md#laughable-task-difficulty), [Simple](PFRPG-Glossary.md#simple-task-difficulty), [Average](PFRPG-Glossary.md#average-task-difficulty), [Tough](PFRPG-Glossary.md#tough-task-difficulty), [Very Difficult](PFRPG-Glossary.md#very-difficult-task-difficulty)*

#### Core Abilities Mapped to Tasks

**Strength** (physical power and endurance)
- Lifting heavy objects
- Busting down doors
- Pushing carts
- Carrying heavy burdens
- Physical force applications

**Agility** (dexterity, balance, and speed)
- Balancing on ledges
- Dodging tumbling boulders
- Moving silently
- Hiding in shadows
- Quick reflexive actions

**Intelligence** (knowledge and learning)
- Education and training
- Knowledge of history
- Reading ancient texts
- Mathematics
- Foreign languages
- Problem solving

**Wisdom** (perception and insight)
- Awareness and observation
- Experience-based judgment
- Intuition and hunches
- Sensing motives
- Willpower and mental fortitude

**Charisma** (force of personality)
- Haggling with vendors
- Calming hostile situations
- Leading troops into battle
- Social persuasion
- Task difficulty based on roleplay quality as determined by PM

*Glossary Terms: [Strength](PFRPG-Glossary.md#strength-core-ability), [Agility](PFRPG-Glossary.md#agility-core-ability), [Intelligence](PFRPG-Glossary.md#intelligence-core-ability), [Wisdom](PFRPG-Glossary.md#wisdom-core-ability), [Charisma](PFRPG-Glossary.md#charisma-core-ability)*

#### Example of Task Difficulty Modification

A PM decides jumping a crevice is normally Average (requires 4+). However, modifications apply per character:
- Fighter with high strength: difficulty reduced to Simple (3+)
- Thief with high agility: difficulty reduced to Simple (3+)
- Cleric carrying large chest: difficulty increased to Tough (5+)
- If Thief carries chest for Cleric: Thief makes Average task, Cleric makes Average
- If Wizard ties rope to Cleric: Cleric's difficulty reduced to Simple (3+)
- Cleric rolls 3 and successfully jumps with aid

### Heroic Rerolls

Player characters are heroes destined for glory and receive mechanical representation through heroic rerolls.

**Base Heroic Rerolls:** 1 per session for any d6 roll, taking the best result

**Heroic Reroll Stacking:** May be expended for any roll where character already gets a reroll for class, race, or other ability
- Example: Thief has natural agility reroll; expending heroic reroll means thief gets 3 total rolls on agility tasks

**Heroic Reroll Rewards:** PM may award additional heroic rerolls for:
- Good roleplay
- Successful heroic actions
- Exceptional character moments

*Glossary Terms: [Heroic Reroll](PFRPG-Glossary.md#heroic-reroll)*

### Exploding Die Mechanic

Many abilities allow die to "explode" when rolling naturally 6. When explosion occurs:
1. Roll original die and get 6
2. Roll that die again
3. Add both results together
4. Continue rolling if additional 6s appear (per ability limitations)

*Glossary Terms: [Exploding Die](PFRPG-Glossary.md#exploding-die-mechanic), [d6](PFRPG-Glossary.md#d6)*

### Rolling a Natural 6

Any d6 roll of 6 triggers special mechanics:

1. Complete the attempted action successfully (task, combat, healing, etc.)
2. Roll another d6 to check for exceptional performance
3. If second roll is also 6: Award 1 Heroic Reroll to character (reward for amazing/masterful execution)
4. Maximum 1 Heroic Reroll per action from rolling 6s

*Glossary Terms: [Rolling a Natural 6](PFRPG-Glossary.md#rolling-a-natural-6), [d6](PFRPG-Glossary.md#d6), [Heroic Reroll](PFRPG-Glossary.md#heroic-reroll)*

## COMBAT SYSTEM

**Glossary References:** See PFRPG-Glossary.md for detailed definitions of all combat-related terms.

### Combat Structure

**Combat Round:** A series of actions from 2+ sides engaged in battle. Round concludes when all participants act. New round begins if combat continues.

**Combat Encounter:** Collection of all combat rounds until one side is defeated

*Glossary Terms: [Combat Round](PFRPG-Glossary.md#combat-round), [Combat](PFRPG-Glossary.md#combat), [Encounter](PFRPG-Glossary.md#encounter)*

### Initiative

Initiative determines action order at combat start and applies to entire encounter (not re-rolled each round).

**Initiative Process:**
1. Roll d6 for enemy group (collective)
2. Roll d6 for each Player Character individually
3. Characters rolling ≥ enemy roll act before enemies
4. Characters rolling < enemy roll act after enemies
5. Players choose action order among themselves

**Initiative Mechanics:**
- Based on agility
- Tied initiative: characters act before enemies
- Not re-rolled each round (exception: abilities that modify initiative)

*Glossary Terms: [Initiative](PFRPG-Glossary.md#initiative), [Agility](PFRPG-Glossary.md#agility-core-ability), [d6](PFRPG-Glossary.md#d6)*

### Surprise

Surprise occurs only at start of combat before initiative.

**Surprise Mechanics:**
1. Roll d6 for each side (PC side vs. enemy side)
2. Side rolling 1-2 loses first combat round action
3. Other side acts normally

**Surprise Requirements:**
- Enemy presence was unknown to surprised side
- Lack of awareness on surprised side's part

*Glossary Terms: [Surprise](PFRPG-Glossary.md#surprise), [Initiative](PFRPG-Glossary.md#initiative), [Combat](PFRPG-Glossary.md#combat)*

### Movement

**Movement in Combat:**
- Character may move then attack OR attack then move
- If character moves away from engaged enemy: stationary enemy gets immediate free normal Melee Attack Action
- Movement enables positioning for ranged attacks, flanking, or tactical advantage

**Engagement:** Character is "engaged" when in melee range of enemy

*Glossary Terms: [Movement](PFRPG-Glossary.md#movement-in-combat), [Melee Attack Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#melee-attack-action), [Attack Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#attack-action)*

### Combat Skill (CS)

Combat Skill is the core attack and defense mechanic applied uniformly across all combat scenarios.

**CS Basis:** Determined by character class, modified by:
- Armor type worn
- Melee weapon skill
- Ranged weapon skill
- General agility

**CS Examples from Classes:**
- Fighter: d6
- Cleric: d6-1
- Thief: d6-1
- Bard: d6-2
- Ranger: d6-1
- Wizard: d6-2

*Glossary Terms: [Combat Skill](PFRPG-Glossary.md#combat-skill-cs), [Fighter](PFRPG-Glossary.md#fighter), [Cleric](PFRPG-Glossary.md#cleric), [Thief](PFRPG-Glossary.md#thief), [Bard](PFRPG-Glossary.md#bard), [Ranger](PFRPG-Glossary.md#ranger), [Wizard](PFRPG-Glossary.md#wizard)*

### Attack Actions

**Melee Attack Action:** Against adjacent enemy

**Ranged Attack Action:** Against enemy at distance (weapon/ability dependent)

**Attack Resolution:**
1. Attacker rolls their CS die
2. Result is damage dealt
3. Defender rolls CS die to "block" damage
4. Blocked damage is subtracted from rolled damage
5. Remaining damage reduces target hp

**Attack Example:**
- Attacker rolls CS d6 = 4 damage
- Defender rolls CS d6-2 = 2 blocked damage
- Net damage = 2 hp lost

*Glossary Terms: [Attack Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#attack-action), [Melee Attack Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#melee-attack-action), [Ranged Attack Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#ranged-attack-action), [Combat Skill](PFRPG-Glossary.md#combat-skill-cs), [Damage](PFRPG-Glossary.md#damage)*

### Defense Actions

Defense occurs after opponent's attack is rolled.

**Defense Resolution:**
1. Target rolls their CS die
2. Result is "blocked damage"
3. Blocked damage subtracted from attack roll result
4. Remaining damage reduces target hp
5. CS rolls resulting in negative blocked damage count as 0 (still roll for other purposes)

**Defense Actions Cannot be Refused:** Must always be rolled when targeted by attack

*Glossary Terms: [Defense Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#defense-action), [Combat Skill](PFRPG-Glossary.md#combat-skill-cs), [Blocked Damage](PFRPG-Glossary.md#blocked-damage), [Damage](PFRPG-Glossary.md#damage)*

### Full Defense Action

At start of combat round, character may forego Attack Action to enter Full Defense stance.

**Full Defense Effects:**
- Character gets no Attack Action that round
- Character re-rolls ALL Defense Actions against them
- Takes best result of each re-rolled defense
- Effect lasts until start of next combat round

**Full Defense Uses:**
- Against heavily damaging enemies
- When party is low on hp
- When holding position strategically

*Glossary Terms: [Full Defense](PFRPG-Glossary.md#full-defense-action), [Combat Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#combat-action), [Defense Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#defense-action), [Combat Round](PFRPG-Glossary.md#combat-round)*

### Melee vs. Ranged Attacks

**Melee Attacks:**
- Target must be adjacent
- Subject to movement rules
- Cannot attack target beyond melee range

**Ranged Attacks:**
- Target at distance
- Maximum range determined by weapon/ability and PM discretion
- Not subject to melee engagement rules

**Combat Skill Application:**
- Melee and Ranged attacks use identical CS mechanics
- Only range and positioning differs

*Glossary Terms: [Melee Attack Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#melee-attack-action), [Ranged Attack Action](PFRPG-Glossary.md#ranged-attack-action), [Range](PFRPG-Glossary.md#range), [Combat Skill](PFRPG-Glossary.md#combat-skill-cs)*

### Combat Example

**Setup:** Kronc (Fighter) attacks Orc with CS d6

**Attacker's Roll:**
- Kronc rolls CS d6 = 4 damage

**Defender's Roll:**
- Orc rolls CS d6-2 = 4 total minus 2 = 2 blocked

**Damage Resolution:**
- 4 damage - 2 blocked = 2 damage to Orc

**Counter Attack:**
- Orc attacks Kronc
- Orc rolls CS d6-2 = 5 minus 2 = 3 damage
- Kronc rolls CS d6 = 5 blocked
- 3 damage - 5 blocked = 0 damage to Kronc

## HEALING, REST & DEATH

**Glossary References:** See PFRPG-Glossary.md for detailed definitions of healing-related terms.

### Stabilization

**Stabilize Mechanic:** Another character can stabilize a 0 hp ally

**Stabilization Process:**
