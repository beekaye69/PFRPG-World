## DETAILED RACE PROFILES

### DWARF: The Underground Specialist

**Quick Profile:** Underground expert, poison resistant, dark vision specialist

**Racial Traits:**
1. **Dark Vision (60 feet)** - See clearly in darkness, no light required
2. **Underground Expertise** - Detect hidden passages, construction, mine shafts; understand underground construction
3. **Poison Resistance** - Poison tasks are simplified (Average task instead of Tough)

**Mechanical Benefits:**
- Dungeons (underground) become easier to navigate
- Hidden doors/passages more likely to be found
- Poisons from monsters/traps less dangerous
- Dark vision eliminates light source dependency

**Limitations:**
- Traits are location-specific (less useful in surface adventures)
- Restricted class options (Cleric preferred, Ranger/Wizard at PM discretion)
- No innate damage or direct combat advantage

**Optimal Class Matchups:**
1. **Cleric** - Strong thematic match (dwarf priest), Righteous Insight pairs well with underground perception tasks
2. **Fighter** - Solid all-rounder, doesn't need special racial synergy
3. **Thief** - Excellent for dungeon delving (lock-picking + underground expertise)

**Optimal Party Role:** Underground specialist, trap detector, poison resistance buffer

**Best Campaigns:** Dungeon-heavy, underground-focused, mining/cave themes

**Equipment Synergies:**
- Ring of Senses (additional perception)
- Crystal Ball (divination for hidden passages)
- Boots of Wall Walking (bonus movement in underground structures)

**Playstyle:** Assume dungeon guide role, use Underground Expertise for encounter prep, leverage Dark Vision for advantage

**Racial Mechanics Explained:**

**Dark Vision Usage:**
- Automatic benefit (always have 60 ft vision in darkness)
- No penalty for fighting in dark (unlike non-dark-vision characters who might be at disadvantage)
- Especially valuable in dungeons and caves
- Works underground, in caves, and indoors without light sources

**Underground Expertise Usage:**
- Grants "Tough task" attempts to find hidden passages/doors that others might not find
- Can detect construction type (dwarven vs. elvish vs. human-built)
- Useful for finding secret rooms, hidden exits, trapped passages
- PM might grant automatic success in some scenarios

**Poison Resistance Usage:**
- When poisoned, poison task becomes Average (4+) instead of Tough (5+)
- Represents biological resistance to common poisons
- Still requires successful save check (not immunity, resistance)
- Some magical poisons might override this

### ELF: The Perception Master

**Quick Profile:** Perceptive, supernaturally resilient, ranged-combat specialist

**Racial Traits:**
1. **Dark Vision (60 feet)** - See clearly in darkness, no light required
2. **Secret Door Finding** - Detect hidden doors with Tough task roll; "glance" makes it laughable in favorable circumstances
3. **Paralysis Immunity** - Cannot be paralyzed by any source
4. **Surprise Resistance** - Only surprised on 1 (instead of 1-3 for others)

**Mechanical Benefits:**
- Superior perception (find secrets more easily)
- Paralysis doesn't work (negates significant monster ability)
- Surprise attacks almost always visible (initiative advantage)
- Dark vision eliminates light requirement
- Generally strong defensive positional advantage

**Limitations:**
- Defensive traits (don't provide damage boost)
- Restricted to specific classes (Ranger/Wizard preferred)
- Less versatile than Human (race-specific benefits matter)

**Optimal Class Matchups:**
1. **Ranger** - Excellent synergy (ranged specialist + perception + Alert)
2. **Wizard** - Good pairing (spellcaster + perception + paralysis immunity from spells)
3. **Thief** - Solid (perception helps detection, surprise resistance helps positioning)

**Optimal Party Role:** Scout, perception specialist, paralysis immunity buffer

**Best Campaigns:** High-intrigue, exploration-focused, perception-based puzzles

**Equipment Synergies:**
- Ring of Senses (stacks perception advantage)
- Boots of Wall Walking (mobility for scouting)
- Ring of Night (additional dark vision utility)

**Playstyle:** Scout ahead (surprise resistance), find secrets, maintain position advantage

**Racial Mechanics Explained:**

**Secret Door Finding:**
- Characters typically need task roll to find secret doors
- Elf gets Tough task (5+) to find
- In "favorable circumstances" (likely hiding spot, obvious hints), PM might grant Laughable task (2+)
- "Glance" ability: Without specifically searching, if in room with secret door, Elf might notice on perception check

**Paralysis Immunity:**
- Spells that paralyze: Don't work on Elf
- Monster abilities that paralyze: Don't work on Elf
- Any effect that paralyzes: Elf is immune
- Extremely valuable defensive trait against many monsters

**Surprise Resistance:**
- Normal characters: Surprised on roll of 1-3 (50%)
- Elf: Surprised only on roll of 1 (17%)
- Means Elf initiative advantage in most ambush scenarios
- Combined with Alert ranger ability: Nearly impossible to surprise

### HALFLING: The Stealth Master

**Quick Profile:** Small, sneaky, evasive, survival specialist

**Racial Traits:**
1. **Large Monster Defense** - Defense reroll vs. large monsters (take best)
2. **Forest Hiding** - Laughable task (2+) in forest, Average (4+) elsewhere
3. **Hidden State** - When successfully hidden, cannot be seen or targeted

**Mechanical Benefits:**
- Larger enemies have harder time hitting small targets (defense boost)
- Exceptional stealth in forests
- When properly hidden, completely protected from attacks
- Excellent evasion mechanics

**Limitations:**
- Traits are situational (less useful vs. humanoid enemies)
- Restricted class options (Thief preferred, others at PM discretion)
- No direct damage or health advantage
- Depends on positioning/stealth tactics

**Optimal Class Matchups:**
1. **Thief** - Excellent match (stealth + evasion + hiding synergy)
2. **Ranger** - Good pairing (survivalist + forest hiding)
3. **Bard** - Interesting (social character who can vanish when needed)

**Optimal Party Role:** Scout, escape specialist, evasion tank (unusual tank variant)

**Best Campaigns:** Wilderness-heavy, stealth-focused, hide-and-seek themed encounters

**Equipment Synergies:**
- Ring of Night (darkness for hiding)
- Edge of Night Dagger (stealth enhancement)
- Boots of Wall Walking (unusual positioning)

**Playstyle:** Use hiding as defensive mechanic, avoid direct combat, use hidden state for repositioning

**Racial Mechanics Explained:**

**Large Monster Defense:**
- When facing monsters with Large ability
- Halfling gets reroll on defense (take best of two rolls)
- Represents difficulty hitting small mobile target
- Useful against giants, dragons, large beasts

**Forest Hiding:**
- In forest/heavy woodland: Laughable task (2+) to hide successfully
- Elsewhere (town, dungeon): Average task (4+)
- Once hidden, gains Hidden state (see below)
- Essentially makes forest an "invisible cloak" for Halfling

**Hidden State:**
- When in Hidden state: Cannot be seen, cannot be targeted
- Must stay motionless (or move very carefully at PM discretion)
- Broken by: Attack, loud noise, obvious movement
- Halfling can hide and wait, then emerge for surprise positioning/backstab

### HUMAN: The Flexible Generalist

**Quick Profile:** Versatile, resourceful, adaptable, extra Heroic Reroll

**Racial Traits:**
1. **Heroic Reroll Bonus** - Start each session with 2 Heroic Rerolls instead of 1

**Mechanical Benefits:**
- More "luck" available for crucial moments
- Can spend rerolls more liberally
- Better action economy in resource spending
- Works with any class and any campaign

**Limitations:**
- Only one racial trait (vs. 2-4 for other races)
- No combat advantage or special ability
- Bonus is resource-based (doesn't change core mechanics)
- Less flavorful than specialized races

**Optimal Class Matchups:**
- **Any class** - Human works equally well with all 6
- **Spellcasters preferred** - Wizard/Bard benefit from extra reroll resource on spellcasting
- **Melee preferred** - Fighter/Thief/Ranger benefit from extra reroll on combat actions

**Optimal Party Role:** Universal flexible role (depends on class choice, not race)

**Best Campaigns:** Any campaign type

**Equipment Synergies:**
- Amulet of Legends (stacks Heroic Reroll bonuses)
- Any resource-hungry build benefits

**Playstyle:** Use resource advantage strategically (save rerolls for crucial moments)

**Racial Mechanics Explained:**

**Heroic Reroll Bonus:**
- Session starts: Human has 2 Heroic Rerolls (instead of 1)
- Can spend flexibly: On task roll, combat roll, spell casting, etc.
- Combination with Amulet of Legends: 2 (racial) + 2 (amulet) = 4 total per session (extremely powerful)
- Bonus refreshes each session (doesn't carry over)

**Resource Management Example:**
- Non-Human: 1 reroll → must choose wisely
- Human: 2 rerolls → can afford 1 "safety" reroll + 1 "strategic" reroll
- This flexibility is the strength

## FAQ: RACE SELECTION

**Q: Which race is strongest?**
A: Context-dependent. Elf in wilderness, Dwarf underground, Human universally flexible, Halfling in specific stealth situations.

**Q: Which race is weakest?**
A: Depends on campaign. If no underground, Dwarf traits less valuable. If no forests, Halfling traits less valuable.

**Q: Can I change races between sessions?**
A: Typically no (builds on character identity). Usually permanent per character. Check with PM.

**Q: Do I have to play the "obvious" race + class combo?**
A: No. Human + Thief is perfectly viable (just doesn't have race synergy). Play what's fun.

**Q: What if I want paralysis immunity and perception?**
A: Play Elf (has both). Or play another race and accept vulnerability.

**Q: Does race affect roleplay?**
A: That's between you and your PM. Some groups lean into it, others don't.
