## 🎭 NPC SYSTEMS INTEGRATION

This document focuses on core Game Master system prompts for managing sessions 
and player interactions.

### Party NPC Companion System
For controlling AI-controlled party members (Healer, Wizard, Fighter, Rogue, Cleric):

**Files to use:**
- `NPC_COMPANION_SYSTEM_PROMPTS_AND_KB.md` (Contains 5 system prompts)
- `NPC_COMPANION_USE_CASES_AND_EXAMPLES.md` (Contains implementation examples)

**What it does:** Enables you to control authentic NPC party companions that 
behave according to their class and develop relationships with the party.

### World NPC Encounter System
For handling encounters with diverse world NPCs (Innkeeper, Farmer, Bandit, Priest, etc.):

**Files to use:**
- `NPC_ENCOUNTER_SYSTEM_PROMPTS.md` (Contains Master NPC system prompt)
- `NPC_BEHAVIOR_GLOSSARY_COMPREHENSIVE.md` (Contains 23+ NPC archetypes)

**What it does:** Enables you to portray authentic non-player characters with 
specific personalities, motivations, and behaviors based on their archetype.

### Integration

These systems work together seamlessly:
- Use party NPC prompts for companion behavior
- Use world NPC prompts for encounters with townspeople, merchants, enemies, etc.
- Both can be active simultaneously
- Party companions may interact with world NPCs using both systems
