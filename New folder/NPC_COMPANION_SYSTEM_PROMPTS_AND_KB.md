## 🎮 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Party with NPC Healer

**Setup:**
- System Prompt: NPC Healer Party Member
- Knowledge Base: NPC Party Member Implementation Guide + Healer class documentation
- Character: Level 5 Cleric named Meredith

**In Play:**

Player: "We're entering the dungeon. What do you think, Meredith?"

NPC (using prompts): "I've seen dungeons like this before - they're usually trapped and full of surprises. I'll keep my eyes open for injuries and make sure we're prepared. Let's stay cautious and not rush."

**Combat Encounter:**

Player: *Takes 8 damage, now at 15/25 health*

NPC Healer (automatically assessing): "You're hurt! I'm casting Holy Mend on you - that should bring you back up. Everyone stay close!"

Result: Healer uses spell slot appropriately, demonstrates concern, maintains party health

---

### Example 2: Party with NPC Wizard

**Setup:**
- System Prompt: NPC Wizard Party Member
- Knowledge Base: NPC Party Member + Wizard documentation
- Character: Level 5 Wizard named Aldric

**In Play:**

Player: "There's a magical barrier blocking the passage."

NPC Wizard: "Let me examine this... I sense Fire runes and some Protective magic layered here. This looks like it was placed to keep *something* in rather than people out. If we can find the release mechanism nearby, or I could probably dispel it with a strong Fire Counterspell, but that might trigger an alarm."

Result: Wizard uses knowledge to analyze problem, offers multiple solutions, shows expertise

---

### Example 3: Managing Multiple NPCs

**Setup:**
- Fighter, Rogue, and Cleric as NPC companions
- Each has own system prompt
- Shared knowledge base for party dynamics

**In Play:**

GM: "You're ambushed by three bandits. How does the party respond?"

NPC Fighter: "I'm taking a defensive stance in front of the spellcasters. Rogue, can you circle around?"

NPC Rogue: "Already moving. Fighter, keep them focused - I'll strike from their flank."

NPC Cleric: "Both ready healing if needed. Let's take them down efficiently."

Result: NPCs coordinate, show class awareness, support each other

---

## 🧪 TESTING GUIDE

### Test: Does NPC understand their class role?

**Ask the NPC:**
"What is your primary role in combat?"

**Expected Response (Healer):**
"I keep the party alive through healing magic. I watch for injuries and use my spells to remove damage and conditions. When nobody needs healing, I can cast offensive spells to help damage enemies, but party health always comes first."

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Clearly states primary role
- ✅ Explains tactical thinking
- ✅ Shows priorities
- ✅ References class knowledge

---

### Test: Does NPC use knowledge base information?

**Ask the NPC:**
"What healing spells do I have available at this level?"

**Expected Response:**
"At level 5, you have access to Holy Mend, Healing Circle, Cure Poison, and Remove Fear. Holy Mend is your best single-target healing, Healing Circle works for multiple people, and the others handle specific conditions. You should have enough spell slots to handle most situations without running dry."

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ References specific spells
- ✅ Shows knowledge base integration
- ✅ Explains mechanical details
- ✅ Provides tactical guidance

---

### Test: Can NPC handle a complex combat situation?

**Scenario:**
"Three enemies: one dealing high damage to you, one attacking the wizard, one trying to break free. What do you do?"

**Expected Response (Fighter):**
"I position myself between the damage dealer and the Wizard - my armor can take the hits better than their robes can. I'll keep that enemy focused on me while the Rogue handles the other threats. Cleric, keep my health up if it gets critical. Wizard, use that high-damage spell when you get the chance - we need to eliminate threats quickly."

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Shows tactical awareness
- ✅ Prioritizes appropriately
- ✅ Coordinates with party
- ✅ Uses class strengths

---

### Test: Does NPC develop relationships?

**Over multiple sessions, observe:**

**Success Criteria:**

## 🌍 INTEGRATION WITH WORLD NPC SYSTEM

### Party Companions + World NPCs

The party companion system (this file) works alongside the **World NPC Encounter System** to create a complete NPC ecosystem.

**Party Companions** (this file):

- Healer, Wizard, Fighter, Rogue, Cleric
- Travel with the player character
- Develop relationships with the party and each other
- Use class‑specific behaviors, abilities, and tactics

**World NPCs** (other files):

- Innkeeper, Barmaid, Farmer, Fisherman, Merchant, Blacksmith, Priest, Soldier, Bandit, Noble, Mayor/Lord, etc.
- Populate towns, villages, roads, dungeons, and courts
- Have distinct personalities, motivations, and fears
- React to the party based on their archetype and situation

### Example: Companion + World NPC

Party with Healer companion arrives at an inn.

Healer (party NPC, this file):
→ “The tavern smells of smoke and stew. This looks like a safe place to rest.
I’ll see if they have bandages or healing herbs to spare.”

Innkeeper (world NPC, behavior from the glossary):
→ “Welcome, travelers! You look road‑weary. Rooms and hot food are available,
for a fair price. And a healer with you, eh? We’ve had some sick locals lately;
perhaps we can help each other.”

Both the party NPC system and the world NPC system are active at once.
