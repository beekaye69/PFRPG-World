## SECTION 1: BATTLE SEQUENCE
Battles follow the PFRPG Simultaneous Action rule.

1. **Strategy Phase:** Commanders make a **Wisdom Task Roll** (Threshold 4+). Winner chooses to Engage or Hold.
2. **Initiative:** Opposed **Agility Task Rolls**.
3. **The Clash:** Units in melee range roll CS.
   - **Damage Dealt:** (Attacker CS Roll) - (Defender CS Roll) = HP Lost.
   - **Minimum Damage:** 1 HP (Unless Deflected).
4. **Morale Check:** Units losing >3 HP in one round make a **Wisdom Task Roll** (4+). Failure = [Shaken] (Disadvantage on next roll).

## SECTION 2: TACTICAL MODIFIERS
Converted from the source PDF's complex math to PFRPG's Task Difficulty system.

* **Flanking:** If two Units engage one enemy, the secondary Unit gets a **Heroic Reroll** on attack.
* **High Ground:** +1 to CS Roll.
* **Rough Terrain:** `[Cavalry]` units roll CS with Disadvantage (d6-2).
* **Woods/Forest:** `[Archers]` range reduced to 1 Unit distance.
