## RULE SUMMARY

Surprise occurs when one side enters combat **unaware** of the other's hostile intent. Surprised combatants may have disadvantage in initiative or act after unsurprised combatants in Round 1.

**Surprise Check Process:**
1. Unaware party makes **Wisdom task (Average 4+ typical)**
2. Success: Not surprised (normal initiative)
3. Failure: Surprised (disadvantage in initiative or acts last in Round 1)

**Special Rule - Elves:** Only get surprised on roll of 1 (instead of normal 1-3 range, making them 17% vs. 50%)

---

## DETAILED MECHANICS

### When Surprise Occurs

| Scenario | Surprise? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Ambush from hiding | YES | Attackers hidden, defenders unaware |
| Both parties aware, draw weapons | NO | Mutual awareness |
| Chase scene, pursuer attacks pursuer | NO | Both aware and moving |
| Sneak attack mid-conversation | YES | Defender unaware of hostile intent |
| Enemy declares intent peacefully, then attacks | NO | Warning given, now combat |

### Surprise Check & Mechanics

**Unaware Party Makes Wisdom Task:**
- Base: d6 roll
- Difficulty: Average (4+) typical
- PM adjusts based on circumstances:
  - Obvious ambush (loud, visible) → Simple (3+) or Laughable (2+)
  - Hidden ambush (quiet, well-concealed) → Tough (5+) or Very Difficult (6)

**Consequences of Failure:**
- **Round 1:** Surprised characters act after unsurprised characters
- **Round 2+:** Surprise ends, normal initiative order resumes

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Obvious Ambush (Simple)

**Setup:** Party walking down hallway, goblins hidden around corner, party has light

**Surprise Check:**
- Visibility: Clear (hallway lit)
- Concealment: Poor (goblins poorly hidden)
- Difficulty: **Simple (3+)**

**Rolls:**
- Fighter: 4 (passes) → Not surprised
- Wizard: 2 (fails) → Surprised
- Cleric: 5 (passes) → Not surprised
- Thief: 3 (passes, barely) → Not surprised

**Result:** 3 not surprised, 1 surprised (Wizard)

**Round 1 Combat Order:**
- Unsurprised (Fighter, Cleric, Thief) act in normal initiative
- Then Wizard acts (despite possibly rolling higher initiative)
- Then goblins act in initiative order

**Round 2 Onward:** Normal initiative order resumes (Wizard no longer at disadvantage)

---

### Example 2: Well-Concealed Ambush (Complex)

**Setup:** Party traveling through thick forest at night, assassins hidden in trees, poor visibility

**Surprise Check:**
- Visibility: Poor (dark, dense trees)
- Concealment: Excellent (trained assassins)
- Difficulty: **Tough (5+)**

**Rolls:**
- Fighter: 3 (fails) → Surprised
- Wizard: 2 (fails) → Surprised
- Ranger (Survivalist): 5 (passes! Uses Wisdom reroll or natural high) → Not surprised
- Thief: 4 (fails) → Surprised

**Result:** 1 not surprised (Ranger), 3 surprised (Fighter, Wizard, Thief)

**Special consideration:** Ranger's Survivalist ability includes wilderness perception, so they may get bonus or reroll on this check (PM discretion)

**Round 1 Combat Order:**
- Assassins act (attackers)
- Ranger acts (aware, acts in normal initiative)
- Fighter, Wizard, Thief act (surprised, act after assassins)

---

## PM REASONING EXAMPLES

### PM Reasoning Example 1: "The party spotted the enemy, but the enemy didn't spot them. Who gets surprise?"

**Situation:**
- Party sees bandits setting up camp from distance
- Party moves into combat range
- Bandits haven't noticed party yet

**PM Reasoning:**
- **Party is NOT surprised** (they're aware)
- **Bandits ARE surprised** (they're unaware)
- Result: Bandits act last in Round 1 despite possibly rolling higher

**Adjudication:**
- Both sides roll initiative normally
- Bandits make surprise check (likely fail)
- Initiative order determined, but bandits act after PCs in Round 1

---

### PM Reasoning Example 2: "An Elf PC is in an ambush. Do they get special advantage?"

**Situation:**
- Party ambushed by assassins
- One party member is Elf
- Elf wants to use "Surprise Resistance" trait

**PM Reasoning:**
- **Elf only gets surprised on roll of 1** (vs. normal 1-3 range)
- Example: Elf rolls 2 on Wisdom check for surprise
- Normally, roll of 2 would mean surprised
- Elf: "No, I'm only surprised on a 1, so I'm not surprised!"
- Elf acts in normal initiative, not at disadvantage

**Adjudication:**
- Other party members make normal Wisdom check (4+ to pass)
- Elf rolls and only fails on 1 (much better odds)
- If party mostly not surprised, advantage is tactical (Elf leads response)

---

## MINI FAQ

**Q: Can I be surprised if I know combat is coming?**  
A: No. Surprise requires lack of awareness. If you know combat is coming, make Wisdom check anyway (average difficulty).

**Q: Does surprise affect my attack damage?**  
A: No. Surprise affects initiative only (you act later in Round 1). Damage rolls are normal.

**Q: Can I use Backstab if I'm not surprised, but enemies are?**  
A: Yes. Backdstab requires target to be unaware/hidden (independent of surprise mechanic). If enemies are surprised and you're positioned well, Backstab is viable.

**Q: Does the Ranger Alert ability help avoid surprise?**  
A: Alert helps with initiative advantage, not surprise checks. Different mechanics.

---

## INTERACTION WITH ELF RACE

**Elf Trait: Surprise Resistance**
- Elves only get surprised on d6 roll of 1 (instead of 1-3)
- This makes Elves 17% likely to be surprised vs. 50% for other races
- Huge advantage in ambush/exploration scenarios

**Strategic Impact:**
- Party including Elf has better ambush defense
- Recommended for Ranger (exploration) or Wizard (survival)
- Makes Elf + Scout class very strong combo

# SECTION 2.3: COMBAT STRUCTURE & ROUNDS
## Atomic Sub-Section Deep Dive

**Title:** PFRPG Section 2.3: Combat Structure & Rounds (Atomic Sub-Section)

**Scope:** Round flow, turn structure, action economy, round-to-round progression

**Related Documents:**
- SECTION_2.1_InitiativeSystem_Atomic.md (Initiative determines round order)

- SECTION_2.5_ActionsInCombat.md (Action types per turn)

**Dependencies:** Sections 1, 2.1

**Format:** Rule + Examples + PM Guidance

## RULE SUMMARY

**A round represents 6 seconds of combat.** Each round, all combatants act once in initiative order. The round structure is:

1. **Initiative order determined** (at combat start)
2. **Round N begins**
3. **Each combatant takes one turn in initiative order**
4. **Turn: Choose action (attack, defend, spell, ability, move)**
5. **Resolve action immediately**
6. **All combatants acted?** → Round ends
7. **Combat still ongoing?** → Start Round N+1 (goto step 2)

---

## COMBAT ROUND FLOW DIAGRAM

```
Round N Begins
    |
    ├─ Character 1 (highest initiative) takes turn
    │  ├─ Declare action (attack / defend / spell / ability / move / Full Defense)
    │  ├─ Resolve immediately
    │  ├─ Apply effects (damage, conditions, etc.)
    │  └─ Turn ends

    | ... (all combatants act)
    |
    └─ All combatants acted?
       ├─ No → Next combatant's turn
       ├─ Yes → Round N ends
           |
           └─ Check: Is combat over?
              ├─ No (enemies alive, party alive)
              │  └─ Start Round N+1 (return to top)
              |
              └─ Yes (one side defeated/fled)
                 └─ Combat ends, resolve loot/consequences
```

2. **Execute action** (roll relevant die, resolve)
3. **Apply effects immediately** (damage, conditions, status)
4. **Turn ends** (next character's turn)

**Key Rule:** Effects are resolved immediately, not batched at end of round
