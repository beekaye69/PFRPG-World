## 📖 CORE COMBAT MECHANICS REFERENCE

### Combat Structure (From PFRPG Rulebook)

**Combat Rounds:**
- Series of actions from 2+ sides engaged in battle
- Each side takes actions, then round ends
- Combat continues until one side is defeated

**Surprise:**
- Roll d6 on each side
- Rolling 1-2 = that side loses first round actions
- If unaware of other's presence

**Initiative:**
- Agility-based task
- Roll d6 for each side
- Higher/equal rolls go before lower rolls
- Players choose action order among themselves
- Initiative NOT re-rolled each round

**Movement & Attack:**
- Character may move THEN attack OR attack THEN move
- If moving away from engaged enemy: stationary enemy gets free normal Melee Attack

**Range:**
- Melee = adjacent enemy
- Ranged = longer distance (weapon/ability range per PM discretion)

**Combat Skill (CS):**
- Used for both Attack and Defence
- Melee and Ranged actions work same way

**Attack Action:**
- Roll CS die
- Result = damage done to enemy

**Defence Action:**
- Target rolls CS die
- Result = blocked damage
- Remaining damage = HP loss

**Full Defence:**
- Forego Attack Action at start of round
- Re-roll ALL Defence Actions that round, taking best result
- Effect lasts until start of next round

**Example Calculation:**
```
Attacker: CS d6, rolls 4 = 4 damage
Defender: CS d6-1, rolls 3, -1 = 2 blocked
Enemy takes: 4 - 2 = 2 damage
```

## 🧙 CLASS COMBAT PROFILES

### FIGHTER PROFILE

**Core Stats:**
- HP: 10 (highest starting HP)
- CS: d6 (full die, no modifier)
- Melee & Ranged: Any weapon, any armor
- Role: Primary damage dealer, tank, leader

**Combat Strengths:**
1. **Consistent Damage:** CS d6 means solid attack rolls (average 3.5 damage per hit)
2. **Multiple Actions:** Can attack + move, or move + attack
3. **Challenge Ability:** Direct attacks to fighter, control enemy actions
4. **Combat Master:** Melee attacks explode on 6, get bonus d6 roll added
5. **High HP:** 10 HP (tied for highest)
6. **Armor Flexibility:** Any armor type

**Combat Weaknesses:**
1. **No Range Advantage:** No bonus to ranged attacks
2. **No Healing:** Can't self-heal in combat
3. **No Magic:** Can't cast spells or special abilities
4. **No Spell Slots:** Purely physical-based combat
5. **No Crowd Control:** Can't stop multiple enemies

**Optimal Combat Positioning:**
- Front line (adjacent to enemies)
- Between ranged allies and melee enemies
- Close enough to use Challenge ability
- NOT isolated (need support healing)

**Resource Management:**
- No spells or limited abilities
- Can use Focus/Deflect equipment
- Heroic Rerolls crucial for tough fights
- Challenge ability: 1 per encounter

**Fighter Combat Strategy:**

**Against Single Strong Enemy (Troll, Minotaur, Dragon):**
1. Use Challenge to lock down its attacks
2. Position allies behind for ranged/spell support
3. Use Focus on weapon when rolls are good
4. Defend allies when they're in danger
5. Apply exploding die combat rolls for massive damage
6. Rely on Combat Master to multiply damage through explosions

**Against Multiple Weak Enemies:**
1. Attack + Move to surround and control space
2. Take full Defence if overwhelmed
3. Focus on eliminating one at a time
4. Use challenge to prevent ambushes
5. Protect squishy allies (wizard, healer)

**Against Mixed Encounters:**
1. Use Challenge on strongest/most dangerous
2. Let ranged allies handle others
3. Switch targets when Challenge ends
4. Play tanking role (take damage for allies)
5. Use Challenge strategically on most threatening enemy

**Fighter Combat Example: Fighter vs Troll**
```
SETUP:
Fighter: HP 10/10, CS d6, Focus x1 sword
Troll: HP 18/18, CS d6, Strong ability (+1 extra damage)

ROUND 1 - Fighter Initiative (rolls 5, Troll rolls 3):

Fighter Action:
- Uses Challenge ability: "Troll, face me!"
- Makes Melee Attack: rolls 5 damage
- Troll Defence: rolls 2, takes 3 damage
- Troll HP: 18 - 3 = 15/18
- Challenge effect: Troll must attack Fighter when possible

Troll Response (must attack Fighter per Challenge):
- Melee Attack vs Fighter: rolls 6
- Exploding die! Rolls again: gets 4
- Total: 6 + 4 = 10 damage (plus Strong bonus +1 = 11 total)
- Fighter Defence: rolls 5, blocks 5 damage
- Fighter takes: 11 - 5 = 6 damage
- Fighter HP: 10 - 6 = 4/10 (DANGER ZONE)

Fighter Situation: Low HP, must act carefully next round

ROUND 2:

Fighter Action:
- Decides: use Focus on weapon for guaranteed 6 damage
- Combat Master triggers: rolls d6 to add = gets 3
- Total damage: 6 + 3 = 9 damage
- Troll Defence: rolls 1, blocks 1 damage
- Troll takes: 9 - 1 = 8 damage
- Troll HP: 15 - 8 = 7/18
- Focus used up (1 per encounter with Focus x1 weapon)

Troll Attack:
- Forced to attack Fighter (Challenge still active)
- Rolls 4 + Strong = 5 damage
- Fighter Defence: rolls 6! Gets Heroic Reroll? (rolls 3, no extra reroll)
- Fighter blocks 6, takes 0 damage
- Fighter HP: 4/10 (still alive)

ROUND 3:

Fighter Action:
- Makes normal Melee Attack: rolls 4
- Troll Defence: rolls 2, takes 2 damage
- Troll HP: 7 - 2 = 5/18

Troll Attack:
- Rolls 3 + Strong = 4 damage
- Fighter Defence: rolls 2, takes 2 damage
- Fighter HP: 4 - 2 = 2/10 (critical)

Fighter Reassessment:
- Fighter at 2/10 HP
- Troll at 5/18 HP
- Fighter could: Full Defence, Retreat, or Continue Fighting
- Decides: Full Defence next round to block more damage
- Could also use Heroic Reroll if available for big attack

ROUND 4:

Fighter Action:
- Uses Full Defence (foregos attack)
- Now re-rolls all Defence Actions, taking best result

Troll Attack:
- Rolls 5 + Strong = 6 damage
- Fighter Defence: rolls 4, re-rolls (Full Defence), gets 6
- Takes best: 6, blocks all 6 damage
- Fighter takes: 0 damage
- Fighter HP: 2/10 (still standing)

[Battle continues with Fighter Full Defence protecting self...]

KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR FIGHTER:
✓ Challenge controls enemy actions
✓ Combat Master exploding die multiplies damage
✓ Full Defence critical when low on HP
✓ Focus weapon saves rounds at critical moments
✓ Single strong enemies are Fighter's specialty

### CLERIC PROFILE

**Core Stats:**
- HP: 8 (mid-range)
- CS: d6-1 (slight combat penalty)
- Melee: Mace, Chain Mail
- Role: Support, healing, undead damage

**Combat Strengths:**
1. **Healing in Combat:** Holy Light heals d6-1 HP, re-roll taking best, minimum 1
2. **Area Healing:** Holy Light heals ALL friendly targets in area
3. **Undead Damage:** Holy Smite does d6-1 damage to undead, no Defence allowed
4. **Limited Spells:** 2 Holy Light OR 2 Holy Smite OR 1 of each per encounter
5. **Righteous Insight:** Re-roll any wisdom task, take best
6. **Bind Wounds:** After encounters, heal 2 HP to all (vs Bind Wounds standard 1 HP)

**Combat Weaknesses:**
1. **CS d6-1:** Lowest attack rolls except special cases
2. **Limited Spell Uses:** Only 2 spell uses per encounter total
3. **Lower HP:** 8 HP means can't sustain lots of damage
4. **Melee Penalty:** Can't take heavy armor (chain mail only)
5. **Area Healing:** Must be strategic about range/positioning
6. **No Escape:** Healing others while injured puts self at risk

**Optimal Combat Positioning:**
- Mid-rank (not front, not completely back)
- In hearing range of entire party (area healing)
- Behind primary tank (Fighter)
- Position to see all allies
- Near allies who might need emergency healing

**Resource Management:**
- 2 holy spells total per encounter (critical resource)
- Decide: healing priority or damage priority
- Heroic Reroll extends spells (gets +1 extra spell)
- After-battle Bind Wounds heals 2 HP (standard is 1)

**Cleric Combat Strategy:**

**Against Undead (Optimal Cleric Scenario):**
1. Use Holy Smite for no-Defence damage (powerful!)
2. Holy Smite does d6-1 damage, re-roll taking best
3. Average 3 damage per Holy Smite with no Defence roll
4. 2 Holy Smites per encounter = 6 damage average to undead
5. Combine with allies attacking for massive damage

**Against Mixed Combat (Multiple Allies Damaged):**
1. Prioritize: Who needs healing most?
2. Holy Light hits all friendly targets in area
3. Heals d6-1, re-roll taking best (min 1)
4. Average 3-4 HP per Holy Light to each target
5. Use Holy Light first (support role primary)
6. Save Holy Smite for undead if present

**Against Single Powerful Enemy:**
1. Role: Support for primary tank (usually Fighter)
2. Holy Light to keep tank alive
3. Mace attacks to contribute damage (CS d6-1 still does damage)
4. Decide: spend spell on damage or healing?
5. If allies healthy: use Holy Smite (damage)
6. If allies hurt: use Holy Light (healing)

**Cleric Combat Example: Cleric Supporting Fighter vs Troll**
```
SETUP:
Cleric: HP 8/8, CS d6-1, Mace, Chain Mail, 2 Holy spells/encounter
Fighter: HP 10/10, CS d6, with Challenge
Troll: HP 18/18, CS d6, Strong

ROUND 1:

Fighter attacks (rolls 5): Troll takes 3 damage (as Fighter example)
Troll HP: 15/18

Troll attacks Fighter (Challenge effect): rolls 10 total → Fighter takes 6 damage
Fighter HP: 4/10 (CRITICAL)

Cleric's Turn:
- Sees Fighter at 4/10 (danger)
- Casts Holy Light on whole party
- Rolls d6-1: gets 3, re-rolls, gets 2, takes best = 3 HP healed
- Heals EVERY friendly target in hearing range for 3 HP
- Fighter: 4 + 3 = 7/10 (much better!)
- Cleric herself heals: 8 + 3 = 11/8 (cap at max 8, overheal)
- Holy Light used: 1 of 2 remaining

ROUND 2:

Fighter attacks (rolls 4): Troll takes 2 damage
Troll HP: 13/18

Troll attacks Fighter: rolls 5 + Strong = 6
Fighter Defence: rolls 2, takes 4 damage
Fighter HP: 7 - 4 = 3/10 (critical again)

Cleric's Turn:
- Fighter at 3/10 again
- Decides: heal again or attack?
- Option A: Holy Light (healing, but no damage to enemy)
- Option B: Holy Smite on Troll (damage but group stays low HP)
- Cleric chooses: Attack with Mace, let Fighter deal with it
- Mace attack: rolls 4, -1 = 3 damage
- Troll Defence: rolls 4, takes 0 damage (blocks all 3)
- Cleric's attack didn't help

Fighter's Concern: "Cleric, I'm taking too much damage!"

ROUND 3:

Fighter continues attacking: decent damage rolls
Troll keeps hitting Fighter hard (Challenge locked in)

Fighter HP drops to 2/10

Cleric's Turn:
- Fighter at 2/10 (CRITICAL)
- Must use Holy Light NOW or Fighter dies
- Casts Holy Light: rolls d6-1 = 5, re-roll = 2, takes 5
- Heals everyone for 5 HP
- Fighter: 2 + 5 = 7/10 (saved!)
- Holy Light used: 2 of 2 (now out of spells!)

Cleric now: No more Holy Light, no more Holy Smite
Can only attack with Mace (CS d6-1, limited damage)

ROUND 4+:

Without spells, Cleric:
- Can only make normal Mace attacks
- Can only defend when Troll attacks
- Hopes Fighter finishes Troll quickly
- If anyone else gets injured: can't heal them!
- This is why spell resource management is critical

BATTLE CONTINUES:
[Fighter must finish Troll before allies die]
[After battle, Cleric's Bind Wounds heals everyone 2 HP]

KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CLERIC:
✓ Healing in combat keeps allies alive
✓ Holy Light area effect heals everyone (position matters!)
✓ 2 spells per encounter is PRECIOUS resource
✓ Must decide: heal or damage each round
✓ Holy Smite for undead (no Defence allowed)
✓ After battle: Bind Wounds extra healing (2 vs standard 1)
✓ Role: Primary support, damage secondary
```

### THIEF PROFILE

**Core Stats:**
- HP: 6 (lowest starting HP)
- CS: d6-1 (melee/ranged penalty)
- Melee/Ranged: Dagger and Bow, Leather armor
- Role: Striker, controller, repositioner

**Combat Strengths:**
1. **Flank:** Attack same enemy as ally = roll twice, take best result
2. **Backstab:** Unaware enemy, successful agility task = 2 CS d6 attacks combined
3. **Nimble:** Re-roll any agility task, take best result
4. **Trap Finding/Disarming:** Detect and remove traps
5. **High Mobility:** Agility-based repositioning
6. **Surprise Attacks:** Backstab can auto-surprise enemies

**Combat Weaknesses:**
1. **Lowest HP:** 6 HP means dies fastest
2. **CS d6-1:** Both melee and ranged attacks weak
3. **Fragile:** Can't take hits, must avoid damage
4. **Limited Armor:** Leather only (no heavy protection)
5. **Needs Positioning:** Flank requires ally adjacent
6. **Backstab Situational:** Requires unaware target

**Optimal Combat Positioning:**
- Side-by-side with Tank (Fighter) for Flank attacks
- Mobile (not locked in place)
- Multiple escape routes available
- Range: next to attacking ally (Flank range)
- Cover/concealment for survivability
- NOT in full front-line combat

**Resource Management:**
- No spells or abilities with limited uses
- Depends on tactical positioning
- Heroic Rerolls on attack rolls critical (low CS d6-1)
- Can Flank unlimited times (no limit per encounter)

**Thief Combat Strategy:**

**Against Single Strong Enemy (Tank is Fighting):**
1. Position adjacent to Tank
2. Use Flank attacks (roll twice, take best)
3. With Nimble bonus on agility: attack rolls better
4. Let Tank get hit, Thief stays at range
5. Multiple allies flanking = enemies outnumbered tactically
6. Use repositioning to avoid focused enemy attacks

**Against Multiple Weak Enemies:**
1. Pick one to focus (like Goblin Pack)
2. Flank if ally is also attacking it
3. Move away if enemy approaches alone
4. Use bow for ranged attacks when alone
5. Reposition between rounds to maintain Flank
6. Mobility is advantage here

**Backstab Scenario (Pre-Combat Surprise):**
1. If unaware of Thief and succeeds agility task
2. Makes 2 CS d6 Melee attacks, combines damage
3. With Nimble re-roll on agility task: higher success
4. Can auto-surprise target (PM discretion)
5. Devastating opening attack before real combat
6. After backstab: real combat begins

**Thief Combat Example: Thief vs Goblin Pack**
```
SETUP:
Thief: HP 6/6, CS d6-1, Dagger + Bow, Leather armor, Nimble ability
Fighter: HP 10/10, CS d6 (adjacent, ready to Flank)
Goblins: 3x HP 2/2, CS d6-3 each

ROUND 1 - Initiative:
Thief rolls: 4, re-rolls for Nimble (agility task): gets 6 (wins!)
Goblins roll: 2

Thief acts FIRST (high initiative):
- Sees 3 goblins, Fighter beside him
- Target: Goblin #1 (closest)
- Uses Flank attack (Fighter is also attacking same target)
- Flank = roll Melee Attack twice, take best
- First roll: 3, -1 = 2 damage
- Second roll: 5, -1 = 4 damage
- Takes best: 4 damage
- Goblin #1 Defence: rolls 2, blocks 2 damage
- Goblin #1 takes: 4 - 2 = 2 damage
- Goblin #1 HP: 2 - 2 = 0/2 (DEAD!)

First goblin eliminated! Thief's mobility pays off.

Fighter's Turn:
- Targets Goblin #2 (different from Thief now)
- Normal attack: rolls 4 damage
- Goblin #2 Defence: rolls 1, takes 4 damage
- Goblin #2 HP: 2 - 4 = 0/2 (DEAD!)

Only Goblin #3 remains (outgunned)

Goblin #3 (desperate):
- Sees two allies dead
- Attacks Thief (closest)
- Rolls 3, -3 = 0 damage
- Thief Defence: rolls 2, blocks 0 damage
- Thief takes: 0 damage

ROUND 2:

Thief Action:
- Goblin #3 is running low on options
- Thief and Fighter adjacent to it
- Position: can either attack or backstab (depends on enemy awareness)
- Chooses: Flank attack again with Fighter
- First roll: 4, -1 = 3
- Second roll: 2, -1 = 1
- Takes best: 3 damage
- Goblin #3 Defence: rolls 1, takes 2 damage
- Goblin #3 HP: 2 - 2 = 0/2 (DEAD!)

Combat ends! All 3 goblins defeated.

Thief Analysis:
- Used Flank attacks (doubled attack rolls)
- Nimble bonus on initiative gave first-round advantage
- Low HP never mattered (died quickly via Flank)
- Teammate coordination made fight easy
- Thief would be in trouble alone (CS d6-1 against 3)

HYPOTHETICAL: Thief Alone vs Same 3 Goblins:
- Would need to separate goblins (tactical movement)
- Can't use Flank (needs ally adjacent)
- Each goblin: 2 HP, CS d6-3
- Thief CS d6-1 vs Goblin CS d6-3
- Thief attacks better, but: 6 HP vs 6 total goblin HP (even)
- Thief could die if hit 2 times by different goblins
- Positioning becomes CRITICAL
- Bow attacks for range, avoid melee if possible
- Thief survives through mobility/positioning, not combat skill

KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR THIEF:
✓ Flank doubles attack rolls (with ally adjacent)
✓ Nimble bonus on agility tasks (initiative, positioning)
✓ Low HP requires smart positioning
✓ Best paired with Tank for Flank attacks
✓ Backstab devastating for pre-combat surprises
✓ Mobility and positioning > direct combat
✓ Teamwork multiplier (Flank is powerful)
```

### WIZARD PROFILE

**Core Stats:**
- HP: 4 (LOWEST - most fragile)
- CS: d6-2 (severe combat penalty)
- Melee/Ranged: Staff of magic missiles, Robes
- Role: Area damage, control, utility

**Combat Strengths:**
1. **Combat Magic:** 2 spells per encounter from Magic Spell List
2. **Spell Variety:** Multiple spell options (damage, control, healing, summoning)
3. **Area Damage:** Spells hit multiple targets (Rain of Fire, Confusion)
4. **Summon Monster:** Control monster for 3-6 rounds
5. **No Combat Melee:** Don't need to fight, stay at range
6. **Heroic Reroll Extension:** Can cast additional spells with Rerolls

**Combat Weaknesses:**
1. **LOWEST HP:** 4 HP (dies in 1-2 solid hits)
2. **LOWEST CS:** d6-2 (staff attacks do almost no damage)
3. **Limited Spells:** Only 2 per encounter (precious resource)
4. **Fragile:** Can't take any hits at all
5. **No Defense:** Robes provide no armor bonus
6. **Range-Dependent:** Must stay far away or die

**Optimal Combat Positioning:**
- 40+ feet from enemies (maximum spell range)
- Behind Tank (Fighter protecting)
- Cover/concealment if possible
- Clear line of sight to targets
- Escape route planned
- NOT in melee range under any circumstances

**Resource Management:**
- 2 spells per encounter (PRECIOUS)
- Each spell is combat action
- Can't move AND cast (usually move OR cast)
- Heroic Rerolls unlock additional spells
- After 2 spells: limited to staff attacks (CS d6-2, ~1 damage per hit)

**Wizard Combat Strategy:**

**Against Single Powerful Enemy (Troll, Minotaur):**
1. **Spell #1 Strategy:** Area damage if multiple enemies (Rain of Fire), or Control (Confusion) if dangerous
2. Alternative: Summon Monster to create ally that fights while Wizard stays back
3. Position 40+ feet away
4. Let Tank (Fighter) engage main enemy
5. Wizard attacks with summoned ally or spells
6. If Tank is losing: use Holy Light spell? NO (Wizard doesn't have it)
7. Use second spell wisely: more damage or strategic advantage?

**Against Multiple Weak Enemies (Goblin Pack):**
1. **Perfect Wizard Scenario:** Area spells shine here
2. Rain of Fire hits up to 4 targets close together
3. One Rain of Fire vs Goblin Pack = potentially kills multiple goblins
4. Confusion spell stops enemies from attacking (no movement, no attacks)
5. Use both spells to control/damage pack
6. Summoned monster fights from front

**Wizard Combat Example: Wizard vs Goblin Pack**
```
SETUP:
Wizard: HP 4/4, CS d6-2 (staff attacks do almost nothing)
Fighter: HP 10/10, CS d6 (holding line)
Goblins: 4x HP 2/2, CS d6-3

ROUND 1 - Initiative:
Wizard rolls: 3
Fighter rolls: 4
Goblins roll: 2

Fighter acts first:
- Attacks Goblin #1: rolls 4, Goblin blocks 1
- Goblin #1 takes 3 damage: 2 - 3 = dead (overkill)

Wizard's Turn:
- Sees 4 goblins (or 3 remaining)
- This is PERFECT for area spell
- Decides: "I cast Rain of Fire on the goblin group"
- Rain of Fire: CS d6-1 attack on up to 4 targets close together
- Rolls: 5, -1 = 4 damage to each goblin
- Re-roll? If rolls d6: yes re-roll, take best. Let's say: reroll gets 3, keeps 4
- Up to 4 goblins each take 4 damage
- Goblin #2: 2 - 4 = 0 (dead)
- Goblin #3: 2 - 4 = 0 (dead)
- Goblin #4: 2 - 4 = 0 (dead)
- Goblin #5 (if present): takes 4 (likely dead too)

WOW: One Rain of Fire spell kills 3-4 weak goblins!

Wizard Analysis:
- One spell: eliminated most of encounter
- Area spells are POWERFUL against groups
- Used 1 of 2 combat spells
- Remaining: 1 more spell this encounter
- Can now use staff attacks safely (no goblins left)

ALTERNATIVE: Confusion Spell Instead:
- Confusion: roll d6-3 for rounds
- Enemies can't move or attack for that duration
- But they can still Defence (Goblins block attacks)
- Not as good for weak goblins (they'd just stand there)
- Better for powerful enemies that need stopping

CONTRAST: Wizard Alone vs Same Goblins:
- 4 HP vs 4 goblins (2 HP each)
- Wizard can attack twice: staff attack d6-2 = ~1 damage each
- First attack: rolls 2, -2 = 0 damage (FAILS)
- Second attack: rolls 3, -2 = 1 damage (kills one)
- Wizard took 0 damage that round? Lucky...
- Next round: Goblins attack back
- Goblin attacks Wizard 4 times (from 3 goblins)
- Average damage: 0 per goblin (CS d6-3)
- But even one hit kills Wizard (4 HP is so fragile)
- Wizard would DIE ALONE fighting goblins

BUT WITH TEAMWORK:
- Fighter protects Wizard
- Wizard uses area spells
- Encounter ends in 1 round
- Everyone lives

KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR WIZARD:
✓ Area spells devastating against groups
✓ 2 spells per encounter PRECIOUS resource
✓ 4 HP means one good hit kills you
✓ MUST stay 40+ feet away
✓ Position behind Tank
✓ Spells are primary combat tool
✓ Staff attacks almost useless (CS d6-2)
✓ Summoned monsters buy time and protection
✓ Teamwork makes Wizard viable
✓ Alone: Wizard dies quickly
```

- Clear voice projection area

**Resource Management:**
- Unlimited songs (3 combat rounds minimum setup)
- Each round must continue singing (can take other actions)
- Switch songs only after 3 rounds

- Heroic Rerolls don't extend songs

**Bard Combat Strategy:**

**Buff Scenario (Party vs Strong Enemy):**
1. Cast Hymn of the Mighty (start of combat)
2. Round 1-3: Singing (+1 damage all allies)
3. Round 3: All allies hit +1 damage per attack

**Bard Combat Example: Bard Buffing Party vs Troll**
```
SETUP:
Bard: HP 6/6, CS d6-2, 1-handed weapon
Fighter: HP 10/10, CS d6
Cleric: HP 8/8, CS d6-1
Troll: HP 18/18, CS d6, Strong

ROUND 1 - Initiative (Bard, Fighter, Cleric, Troll):

Bard Action:
- Decides: Start Hymn of the Mighty (+1 damage all allies)
- "I sing an inspiring battle hymn!"
- Song begins: needs 3 rounds to establish
- Can move and take other actions while singing
- Doesn't take damage from singing

Fighter Action (Benefiting from Hymn already?):
- Hmm, technicality: does buff apply immediately or after 3 rounds?
- PM decides: Song needs 3 FULL rounds before effect
- Fighter does normal attack: rolls 5 damage
- Troll blocks 2, takes 3 damage
- Troll HP: 15/18

Cleric Action (while Bard is singing):
- Attacks Troll: rolls 3, -1 = 2 damage
- Troll blocks 1, takes 1 damage
- Troll HP: 14/18

Troll Attack:
- Attacks Fighter: rolls 5 + Strong = 6
- Fighter Defence: rolls 4, takes 2 damage
- Fighter HP: 8/10

ROUNDS 2-3:
- Bard continues Hymn (singing all 3 rounds)
- Fighter and Cleric keep attacking
- Troll keeps attacking (focused on Fighter)
- HP slowly decreases

END OF ROUND 3:
- Hymn of the Mighty now ACTIVE
- All allies now do +1 damage

ROUND 4:

Fighter Action (NOW getting +1 bonus):
- Attacks Troll: rolls 5 + 1 (Hymn bonus) = 6 damage
- Troll blocks 2, takes 4 damage
- Troll HP: 10/18 (significant damage boost)

Cleric Action:
- Attacks Troll: rolls 3, -1 = 2, +1 (Hymn) = 3 damage
- Troll blocks 1, takes 2 damage
- Troll HP: 8/18

Combined Effect:
- Fighter: +1 per turn = 5 total extra damage by round 8+
- Cleric: +1 per turn = 5 total extra damage by round 8+
- Troll takes 4 more total damage just from buffs
- Bard effectively contributed damage without attacking!

ALTERNATIVE: Lay of Deflection Song:

ROUND 1-3:
- Bard sings: "All allies take -1 damage"
- Fighter gets hit normally but blocks 1 extra
- Cleric gets hit but blocks 1 extra

Fighter takes hit:
- Normal: Troll rolls 6, Fighter Defence 4, takes 2
- With Lay: Fighter takes 2 - 1 = 1 damage
- Per encounter: saves 6+ damage total

By Round 8+:
- Fighter has taken 6 less damage from Lay of Deflection
- Fighter could have taken 8 total damage, now only 2
- Fighter survives longer!

ANOTHER OPTION: Melody of Madness (CC):

ROUND 1:

### RANGER PROFILE

**Core Stats:**
- HP: 10 (tied for highest, like Fighter)
- CS: d6-1 (melee and ranged penalty, like Thief/Cleric)
- Melee/Ranged: Sword and Long Bow, Leather armor
- Role: Ranged striker, environmental specialist, support

**Combat Strengths:**
1. **Ranged Mastery:** Either 1 exploding ranged attack OR 2 ranged attacks at different targets
2. **Alert:** Party rerolls surprise, Ranger rerolls initiative in woodland/cavern
3. **Survivalist:** Non-combat tasks re-roll in wilderness/caverns
4. **Tied Highest HP:** 10 HP (like Fighter)
5. **Sword and Bow:** Versatile combat options
6. **Woodland Bond:** Strong in environmental play

**Combat Weaknesses:**
1. **CS d6-1:** Both melee and ranged attacks weak
2. **Conditional Abilities:** Only work in woodland/cavern (not in dungeon)
3. **No Healing:** Can't support allies
4. **No Area Spells:** Single target or split attacks
5. **No Armor Bonus:** Leather only
6. **Niche Role:** Weaker in stone dungeons (common location)

**Optimal Combat Positioning:**
- Ranged distance (not adjacent)
- On high ground if possible
- Behind Tank for protection
- Can see targets clearly
- Have movement options

**Resource Management:**
- Unlimited ranged attacks
- Choose: 1 exploding OR 2 attacks per round
- Exploding attacks risk missing (single target, needs 6)
- 2 attacks spread damage (multiple targets or confirmed damage)
- No spell slots or limited abilities

**Ranger Combat Strategy:**

**In Woodland/Cavern (Optimal):**
1. Reroll initiative (Ranger has advantage)
2. Survivalist tasks have reroll (non-combat perks)
3. Alert party to dangers
4. Use ranged superiority

**Single Strong Target (Troll):**
1. Use exploding ranged attack (risk high reward)
2. Roll: need 6 to explode, then add next d6
3. Against Troll CS d6: likely blocked (Troll blocks d6 = average 3.5)
4. Successful explosion deals significant damage
5. Combine with Fighter's attacks

**Multiple Targets (Goblin Pack):**
1. Use 2 ranged attacks option
2. Split attacks between two different goblins
3. Targets each reroll Defence Actions (Ranger's weakness)
4. Not ideal for Ranger (Wizard's area spells better)
5. Better than 1 exploding attack against multiple

**Ranger Combat Example: Ranger vs Goblin Pack**
```
SETUP:
Ranger: HP 10/10, CS d6-1 (ranged), Long Bow
Fighter: HP 10/10, CS d6
Goblins: 4x HP 2/2, CS d6-3

ROUND 1 - Ranger's Ranged Mastery Choice:

Option A: 1 Exploding Ranged Attack
- Choose 1 goblin
- Rolls d6 for attack: rolls 2, -1 = 1 damage
- Rolls low, doesn't explode
- Goblin Defence: rolls 2, -3 = 0, takes 1 damage
- Goblin takes 1 damage: 2 - 1 = 1/2 remaining

Option B: 2 Ranged Attacks (Different Targets)
- Target Goblin #1: rolls 4, -1 = 3 damage
- Goblin #1 Defence: rolls 1, -3 = 0, takes 3 damage
- Goblin #1: 2 - 3 = 0 (dead!)
- Target Goblin #2: rolls 3, -1 = 2 damage
- Goblin #2 Defence: rolls 2, -3 = 0, takes 2 damage
- Goblin #2: 2 - 2 = 0 (dead!)

Option B is MUCH better! (killed 2 goblins vs 1)

Fighter attacks Goblin #3: kills it
Remaining Goblins: 1 of 4 left

Ranger could have used:
- Option A (1 exploding): risky, low damage expected
- Option B (2 attacks): safe, reliable, killed 2

CONTRAST: Fighter vs Same Goblins:

Fighter 1 Attack: kills 1 goblin
Ranger Option B: kills 2 goblins
Ranger advantage: damage spread!

WIZARD vs Same Goblins:
Wizard Rain of Fire: kills all 3-4 at once!
Wizard advantage: area damage superior

RANGER ROLE: Versatile striker, not specialist

When Ranger shines:
- Multiple targets that can't be hit by area spells
- Environmental bonuses (woodland/cavern)
- Steady damage output
- Support role with Alert ability

KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR RANGER:
✓ Ranged Mastery: choose 1 exploding OR 2 attacks
✓ 2 attacks better for multiple targets
✓ 1 exploding attack risky but rewarding
✓ Alert: reroll surprise (party benefit!)
✓ Initiative reroll in woodland/cavern (advantage)
✓ HP 10: tied for highest (like Fighter)
✓ CS d6-1 ranged: not strong attacker
✓ Leather armor only
✓ Niche environmental bonuses

- **Weakness:** Both melee-based, vulnerable to ranged
- **Example:** Fighter and Thief kill goblins in 1-2 rounds

### Wizard + Fighter
- **Synergy:** Wizard area spells, Fighter protects Wizard
- **Strength:** Wizard doesn't die, massive area damage
- **Weakness:** If Fighter distracted, Wizard vulnerable
- **Example:** Rain of Fire kills goblins, Fighter protects

## ⚔️ MONSTER COMBAT INTERACTION

### Fighter vs Monsters

**Strong Monsters (d6 CS):**
- Fighter CS d6 vs Monster CS d6 = even fight
- Fighter Challenge = Fighter wins (controls enemy actions)
- Combat Master explosions = Fighter multiplier advantage
- Expected: Fighter wins vs single strong monster

**Weak Monsters (d6-2 or d6-3 CS):**
- Fighter overwhelming advantage
- Multiple weak monsters = Fighter still wins
- Takes longer but consistent damage advantage

### Wizard vs Monsters

**Group Monsters:**
- Wizard area spells = massive advantage
- Rain of Fire on group = kills multiple at once
- Confusion spell stops group attacks = safe round

**Single Strong Monster:**
- Wizard area spells less useful
- Only 2 spells per encounter = limited resource
- Must rely on summon + staff (weak)
- Disadvantaged vs single strong monster

### Class-Specific Matchups

**Wizard vs Troll (Single Strong):**
- Challenge: Wizard only has 2 spells
- If using both spells: troll still has 10+ HP
- Wizard must hide behind Fighter
- Unfavorable for Wizard alone

**Wizard vs Goblin Pack (Multiple Weak):**
- Challenge: None (Wizard dominates)
- One Rain of Fire kills multiple goblins
- Wizard MVP of encounter
- Extremely favorable for Wizard

**Cleric vs Undead:**
- Holy Smite does d6-1 damage (no Defence allowed!)
- Against other monsters: Holy Smite does normal damage
- Against undead: Holy Smite is devastating
- Cleric strong vs undead

## 📋 COMBAT DECISION FLOWCHART

```
WIZARD COMBAT DECISION:

"I see Troll (single monster)"
├─ Do I have allies?

│  └─ NO → DON'T FIGHT (4 HP can't survive)
│           Run or hide

"I see Goblin Pack (4 goblins)"
├─ THIS IS PERFECT FOR WIZARD
├─ Use Rain of Fire: kills multiple
└─ Victory!

FIGHTER COMBAT DECISION:

├─ Use Challenge ability
├─ Lock down attacks

└─ Victory!

"I see Goblin Pack"
├─ Attack closest goblin
