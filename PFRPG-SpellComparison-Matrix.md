### COMBAT SPELL DETAILS

#### SPELL 1: AID FROM BEYOND
**Type:** Support/Resource Grant  
**Action Cost:** 1 combat action  
**Roll:** No roll required (automatic effect)  
**Duration:** Current encounter  

**Mechanics:**
- Grant 1 selected ally a Heroic Reroll for this encounter
- Multiple castings: Can target different allies (up to 2 with both spells per encounter)
- No roll required: Always succeeds

**Strategic Impact:**
- Amplifies ally resources
- Enables more aggressive play by parties
- Synergizes with Bard's reroll-heavy abilities

**Optimal Scenarios:**
- Difficult encounters where reroll might save the day
- Enabling risky but high-reward plays
- Supporting Bard (Charming reroll) or Thief (Backstab positioning)

**Newbie Tip:** Use on ally most likely to need it (lowest HP or key damage dealer)

---

#### SPELL 2: ARCANE ARMOR
**Type:** Defensive Buff  
**Action Cost:** 1 combat action  
**Roll:** No roll required  
**Duration:** Entire encounter  

**Mechanics:**
- Target gains: Defense rolls become CS d6 (universal, not class-limited)
- Additional benefit: Defense rolls are rerolled (take best)
- Effect stacks: Each casting grants separate armor instance

**Strategic Impact:**
- Converts low-CS classes to reliable defenders
- Multiple castings create very defensive party
- Counters large damage threats

**Optimal Scenarios:**
- Protecting low-CS allies (Bard, Wizard)
- Encounter with high-damage enemies
- Tactical defensive positioning

**Newbie Tip:** Usually cast on lowest-defense ally first

---

#### SPELL 3: CONFUSION
**Type:** Crowd Control  
**Action Cost:** 1 combat action  
**Roll:** CS d6-3 (minimum 1) to determine duration  
**Duration:** d6-3 combat rounds (minimum 1)  

**Mechanics:**
- Target cannot move or attack
- Target CAN still defend (doesn't eliminate threat entirely)
- Ends early if target is damaged (breaks concentration)
- No reroll on duration (fixed by initial roll)

**Strategic Impact:**
- Removes enemy from combat temporarily
- Frees up ally to focus on other threats
- BUT: Doesn't prevent damage to confused enemy

**Optimal Scenarios:**
- Splitting dangerous enemies from party focus
- Controlling boss while party handles adds
- Area control in multi-enemy fights

**Newbie Tip:** Confusion is NOT disable—it just stops the enemy from attacking/moving. They still block attacks.

---

#### SPELL 4: DARK BOLT
**Type:** Ranged Damage  
**Action Cost:** 1 combat action  
**Roll:** CS d6-2 (roll twice, take best)  
**Explosion:** Yes, on natural 6 (may explode)  

**Mechanics:**
- Ranged attack vs. target
- Target may defend (rolls defense CS)
- Damage = attack roll minus blocked damage
- May explode on natural 6 (roll additional d6, add together)

**Strategic Impact:**
- Reliable ranged damage for Wizard
- Safest spell for damage dealers
- Consistent performance

**Optimal Scenarios:**
- General offense when unsure
- Ranged enemies (safely at distance)
- Multi-round sustained damage

**Newbie Tip:** Use Dark Bolt as default spell when unsure which spell to cast

---

#### SPELL 5: RAIN OF FIRE
**Type:** Area-of-Effect Damage  
**Action Cost:** 1 combat action  
**Roll:** CS d6-1 (roll twice, take best) applies to ALL targets  
**Targets:** Up to 4 enemies in close proximity  

**Mechanics:**
- Single roll applies to all targets
- All targets roll their own defense
- Damage varies per target (based on their defense)
- Useful for hitting multiple weak enemies

**Strategic Impact:**
- Efficient multi-enemy damage
- Scales with number of targets
- Single roll vs. multiple targets (balanced)

**Optimal Scenarios:**
- Encounter with 3+ weak enemies (goblins, zombies)
- Clustered enemies
- Clearing mooks while party handles boss

**Newbie Tip:** Aim for encounters with multiple weak enemies to maximize efficiency

---

#### SPELL 6: SUMMON MONSTER
**Type:** Action Economy  
**Action Cost:** 1 combat action  
**Roll:** CS d6-2 (minimum 2) to determine duration and strength  
**Duration:** d6-2 combat rounds (minimum 2)  

**Mechanics:**
- Summoned creature acts under caster control (not separate entity)
- Creature acts as bonus action (doesn't consume caster action)
- If roll includes natural 6: Stronger creature
- If second roll also 6: Even stronger

**Monster Options:**
- Roll 2-3: Goblin (CS d6-3, 2 hp)
- Roll 4-5: Orc (CS d6, 5 hp)
- Roll 6: Troll (CS d6+1, 10 hp) OR Orc if already at roll 6

**Strategic Impact:**
- Expands action economy (summoned creature takes actions)
- Useful for action economy-heavy parties
- Scales with luck (natural 6s = better creatures)

**Optimal Scenarios:**
- Outnumbered encounters
- Protecting low-HP allies (summon takes hits)
- Extending combat duration for healing

**Newbie Tip:** Summon doesn't replace your action (you still act), so it's pure action amplification

## SPELL SELECTION STRATEGY BY PARTY COMPOSITION

### High-Damage Party (Fighter + Thief + Ranger)
**Recommended Spells:**
1. Confusion (control phase)
2. Aid from Beyond (amplify rerolls for burst damage)

**Rationale:** Party already does damage well. Use magic for control and resource amplification.

---

### Low-Defense Party (Wizard + Bard + Thief)
**Recommended Spells:**
1. Arcane Armor (primary spell)
2. Aid from Beyond (secondary)

**Rationale:** Party vulnerable. Defense buff is critical.

---

### Solo Wizard
**Recommended Spells:**
1. Dark Bolt (reliable damage)
2. Confusion (crowd control)

**Rationale:** Need both offense and defense against multiple enemies.

---

### Mixed Party (Cleric + Fighter + Ranger + Wizard)
**Recommended Spells:**
1. Confusion or Rain of Fire (varies by encounter)
2. Aid from Beyond (supports any build)

**Rationale:** Flexible party, adapt spells to encounter type.

## FREE FORM MAGIC GUIDELINES

### What is Free Form Magic?

**Definition:** Creative problem-solving magic performed outside combat.

**Constraints:**
- 2 per session
- Out of combat only
- PM determines difficulty
- Failed attempt = slot wasted (no second chance)

### Common Free Form Magic Applications

| Application | Typical Difficulty | Success Effect |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Creation** (boat, rope, bridge) | Average | Item appears |
| **Conjure** (food, water, light) | Simple | Resource provided |
| **Detection** (secret doors, traps) | Tough | Information revealed |
| **Transformation** (shape, appearance) | Very Difficult | Character/object transformed |
| **Communication** (telepathy, animal talk) | Average | Communication established |
| **Levitation/Flight** | Very Difficult | Short-term flight |
| **Environmental Control** (weather, fire) | Tough | Effect manifests |

### PM Guidance for Free Form Magic

- **Failure Cost:** Spell slot wasted (no refund), effect doesn't happen
- **Creative Problem-Solving:** Reward creative thinking with lower difficulty
- **Balanced Play:** Ensure Free Form Magic doesn't trivialize exploration
- **Spell Scope:** "Create a bridge" → reasonable. "Teleport to moon" → unlikely

**Q: Can I use Heroic Reroll on spell casting?**
A: Yes, on damage roll or defense roll against spell, or Free Form Magic task roll.
