## NORTHERN TRADE ROAD – DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### Route Structure

**Segment 1: Crossroads to Northern Farmstead Zone (0.0 – 2.0 miles)**

**Starting Location:** Crossroads Militia Barracks/Gate  
**Distance:** 2.0 miles  
**Travel Time:** 50 minutes walk, 75 minutes wagon  
**Terrain:** Transition from military fortification to established farmland  

**Route Description:**

Leaving Crossroads northward, the militia barracks and fortified area fall behind. The landscape opens into organized agricultural land—wheat fields dominate the view, extending across rolling terrain.

The road itself is well-maintained stone-paved sections alternating with packed earth. It's clearly a priority route maintained by both settlements.

**Milestones:**
- 0.0 mi: Crossroads Gate
- 0.5 mi: Militia checkpoint station passes behind
- 1.0 mi: Pure farmland zone, road straightens
- 1.5 mi: Northern farmland deepens, fewer visible structures
- 2.0 mi: First major waystation area

**Northern Farmstead Zone:**

A cluster of 4-6 satellite farms support Crossroads militia logistics. These aren't individually named like East Road farms, but collectively represent regional grain production contracts.

**Farm Types:**
- Grain production (primary)
- Some mixed crops
- Livestock support facilities
- Militia supplier contracts

**NPCs:** Variable militia liaison officers, rotating farm managers

**Services:**
- Fresh produce available at farm gates
- Water from farm wells (ask permission)
- Emergency shelter possible
- Militia communication outpost

**Environmental Details:**

**Sensory:**
- Sight: Organized grain fields, some equipment (plows, carts), pastoral structures
- Sound: Wind through crops, occasional farm work, bird calls
- Smell: Grain scent, hay, cultivated land
- Temperature: Open fields, warm in summer, exposed

### Segment 2: Northern Farmstead Zone to Kilhel Approach Gateway (2.0 – 4.0 miles)

**Distance:** 2.0 miles  
**Travel Time:** 1 hour walk, 90 minutes wagon  
**Terrain:** Continued farmland transitioning to approach territory  

**Route Description:**

As you continue northward, the immediate signs of Crossroads authority fade. The farmland continues but becomes less intensively cultivated. You're entering the regional buffer zone between the militia outpost and the major city.

The road quality improves—more stone-paved sections, less variable surface. It's clearly a major trade route maintained by Kilhel standards.

**Milestones:**
- 2.0 mi: Northern farmsteads behind you
- 2.5 mi: Road quality improves noticeably
- 3.0 mi: Last scattered farmsteads visible
- 3.5 mi: Clear transition zone; agriculture gives way to approach territory
- 4.0 mi: Kilhel Approach Gateway becomes visible

**Kilhel Approach Gateway:**

A formal checkpoint marks the approach to Kilhel. This isn't fortified like Crossroads, but represents civic control and merchant guild oversight.

**Gateway Features:**
- Guard station (3-5 city militia)
- Merchant guild checkpoint
- Toll collection (possible, variable)
- Safe passage verification
- Information/news exchange point

**NPCs:**

**City Guard Captain** (or representative)
- Role: Verify travelers, collect tolls if applicable

**Distance:** 4.0 miles  
**Travel Time:** 2 hours walk, 3 hours wagon  
**Terrain:** Final approach; increasing urban indicators  

**Route Description:**

As you travel the final 4 miles, the landscape transforms. You begin seeing increasingly clear signs of a major settlement ahead.

The road itself improves dramatically—well-paved stone, clearly maintained to high standards. Roadside infrastructure appears: way-markers, directional stones, merchant signs.

The terrain rises gradually. Kilhel sits on higher ground, dominating the landscape. As you approach, the city becomes progressively more visible—walls, towers, gates.

**Milestones:**
- 4.0 mi: Gateway behind you; clear approach begins
- 4.5 mi: Road quality excellent; merchant signs visible
- 5.0 mi: Outskirts of settlement area (scattered buildings, craft workshops)

**Distance:** 1.5 miles  
**Travel Time:** 35-40 minutes walk, 60 minutes wagon  
**Terrain:** Agricultural plateau, slight elevation changes  

**Route Description:**

Leaving Eldridge westward through the West Gate, the town's structures quickly fade behind. The landscape opens into organized farmland—grain and vegetable cultivation dominate.

**Travel Time:** 1.5-2 hours walk, 2.5 hours wagon  
**Terrain:** Transition from settled farmland to frontier settlement  

**Route Description:**

As you continue westward away from Eldridge, the landscape gradually transitions. The intensively cultivated farmland gives way to more mixed terrain—patches of forest, natural vegetation, less organized agriculture.

# ROUTE 4: KILHEL SPUR (Crossroads ↔ Tiny Stump via Mid-Route)

**Status:** Fully developed, playable  
**Strategic Purpose:** Connect militia outpost to frontier settlement directly  
**Distance:** 5.5 miles

## KILHEL SPUR – DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### Route Purpose

The Kilhel Spur provides a direct connection between Crossroads (militia hub) and Tiny Stump (frontier settlement) without routing through Eldridge. This creates a triangle of settlements with multiple travel options.

**Travel Optimization:**
- Crossroads to Tiny Stump direct: 5.5 miles (2.5-3 hrs walk)
- vs. Crossroads → Eldridge → Tiny Stump: 6.5 miles (2.5-3 hrs walk) – more circuitous
- Strategic value: Reduces travel time and logistics coordination

---

### Segment 1: Crossroads to Mid-Route Trading Post (0.0 – 2.5 miles)

**Distance:** 2.5 miles  
**Travel Time:** 1 hour walk, 90 minutes wagon  
**Terrain:** Mixed agricultural, transition zone  

**Route Description:**

Leaving Crossroads northwest, the militia fortification quickly passes behind. The landscape opens into mixed agricultural terrain—a blend of cultivated fields and natural vegetation.

The road is secondary-quality—well-maintained but less intensively paved than northern route. It's functional and regular-traffic.

**Milestones:**
- 0.0 mi: Crossroads Gate
- 0.5 mi: Militia structures fade
- 1.0 mi: Open transitional terrain
- 1.5 mi: Mixed agriculture begins
- 2.0 mi: Waystation approach visible
- 2.5 mi: Mid-Route Trading Post

**Mid-Route Trading Post (2.5 miles):**

   │
Tiny Stump
(frontier)
```

**Benefits:**
