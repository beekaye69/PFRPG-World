## CLASS MULTICLASS CONSIDERATIONS

**Note:** PFRPG doesn't have multiclassing mechanically. However, party composition and character roleplay can simulate specialized roles.

**Example:** "Cleric-Coded Fighter"
- Play Fighter class
- Roleplay as holy warrior
- Use Holy Water items for thematic consistency
- Equipment choices reflect cleric aesthetic

**Mechanical Note:** This is flavor only—you get Fighter mechanics, not Cleric mechanics.
