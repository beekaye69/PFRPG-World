---

## 1. MAJOR ONGOING CONFLICTS

### CONFLICT #1: "DEFENSIVE PREPAREDNESS DISAGREEMENT"
**Status:** ACTIVE (escalating importance)  
**Severity:** MEDIUM (affects settlement safety)  
**Timeline:** Weeks 2-12 (accelerating if goblin sightings increase)

**THE CORE ISSUE**
```
QUESTION: How quickly should settlement build defensive palisade wall?

POSITION A (Torvin's view): MODERATE-AGGRESSIVE
- Wall needed before winter
- Goblin threat is serious but manageable
- Timeline: 6-month construction starting Month 6
- Investment: 200+ gp materials, significant labor
- Reasoning: "Prudent preparation, not panic"

POSITION B (Elena's view): CAUTIOUS-DIPLOMATIC
- Should assess threat thoroughly first
- Military liaison needed (Captain Thorne)
- Timeline: 8-month construction starting Month 8
- Investment: Same, but planned slower pace
- Reasoning: "Know enemy before committing resources"

POSITION C (Military advisor view): AGGRESSIVE (from Crossroads)
- Wall needed IMMEDIATELY
- Threat level is HIGH
- Timeline: Rush construction (4 months, Month 5 start)
- Investment: 250+ gp (expedited costs)
- Reasoning: "Goblin threat escalating, delay is danger"

POSITION D (Practical view - Gareth): REALISTIC
- Wall is feasible but labor-intensive
- Current workload = 2-3 months to prepare materials
- Timeline: Early construction (Month 6) is realistic
- Investment: Materials first, labor spread
- Reasoning: "Do it right or don't do it at all"
```

### CONFLICT #2: "LAND & GOVERNANCE LEGITIMACY DISPUTE"
**Status:** DORMANT (could activate)  
**Severity:** HIGH (affects settlement existence)  
**Timeline:** Could erupt if: population grows significantly, conflict with external authority

**THE CORE ISSUE**
```
QUESTION: Who legitimately owns/governs the settlement land?

HISTORY:
- Settlement built on "frontier land" (unclaimed by major power)
- Eldridge granted implicit recognition (trading relationship)
- But: Potential tribal claims, potential feudal claims (Kilhel)
- Current: No formal dispute, but unresolved uncertainty

POTENTIAL CLAIMANTS:
1. Tribal groups (pre-human settlement presence possible)
2. Kilhel feudal system (expanding territorial claims)
3. Eldridge (already established relationship)
4. Settlement itself (developing independence claim)

CURRENT STATUS:
- Mostly unexamined and unresolved
- Everyone operating "as if" settlement is legitimate
- But documentation is thin
- High-stakes issue if external authority challenges
```

**WHAT COULD TRIGGER CONFLICT**
```
SCENARIO A: Tribal Contact
- Indigenous people contact settlement
- Claim ancestral/spiritual rights to land
- Demand recognition, compensation, or settlement agreement
- Could be peaceful negotiation or hostile confrontation

SCENARIO B: Kilhel Feudal Expansion
- Duke of Kilhel asserts territorial expansion
- Demands settlement accept his authority
- Offers: Protection, trade access
- Demands: Taxes, obedience, formal fealty
- Settlement faces: Independence vs. security choice

SCENARIO C: Eldridge Formal Authority
- Eldridge formalizes settlement as outpost
- Offers: Official recognition, military support
- Demands: Official governance, tax structure, loyalty
- Settlement faces: Benefits vs. autonomy choice

SCENARIO D: Internal Declaration of Independence
- Tiny Stump declares formal independence
- Establishes own government structure
- Demands external recognition
- Could provoke external power response
```

**STAKEHOLDERS & POSITIONS**
```
TORVIN STONEHAMMER:
- Wants: Settlement autonomy maintained
- Ideal: Friendly external relationships without domination
- Concern: Loss of settlement control to external power

ELENA REDWOOD:
- Wants: Formal legitimacy (reduces uncertainty)
- Ideal: Negotiated arrangement preserving autonomy
- Concern: Community divided by governance dispute

FIONA CRAFTSMITH:
- Wants: Trade security (predictable legal status)
- Ideal: Recognized trading rights, merchant protections
- Concern: Trade disrupted by governance change

ALDIC FARMWRIGHT:
- Wants: Land security (ownership certainty)
- Ideal: Formal recognition of settlement claim
- Concern: Disputed land claims threaten farming

COMMON SETTLERS:
- Wants: Certainty and stability
- Concern: Losing land investment if claims disputed
- Ideal: Clear, recognized ownership
```

**RESOLUTION PATHS**
```
PATH A: Diplomatic Negotiation

### CONFLICT #3: "GOBLIN THREAT ASSESSMENT DIVIDE"
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-8 (escalates with events)

**THE CORE ISSUE**
```
QUESTION: How serious is the goblin threat actually?

ASSESSMENT A (Military - Captain Thorne): HIGH THREAT
- Evidence: Multiple scouting reports, organized patterns
- Interpretation: Preparing for organized campaign
- Concern: Deep Father cult activities driving expansion
- Recommendation: Immediate fortification, military preparation

ASSESSMENT B (Settlement perspective): MODERATE CONCERN
- Evidence: Occasional scouts, no coordinated attacks
- Interpretation: Natural frontier danger, manageable
- Concern: Over-reaction wastes resources
- Recommendation: Defensive preparation but no panic

ASSESSMENT C (Brother Aldwin - Spiritual): MYSTICAL THREAT
- Evidence: Spiritual disturbances, unusual animal behavior
- Interpretation: Darker forces stirring (magical evil)
- Concern: Threat is deeper than physical danger
- Recommendation: Spiritual preparation + physical defense

ACTUAL THREAT LEVEL (DM KNOWLEDGE): MEDIUM-ESCALATING
- Current: Moderate danger (scouts, no attack phase yet)
- Trajectory: Could escalate significantly if ignored
- Root cause: Deep Father cult activities (real threat)
- Hidden: Goblin organizing for larger incursion (1-2 months away)
```

**DISAGREEMENT IMPACTS**
```
IF MILITARY IS RIGHT:
- Settlement needs rapid preparation
- Risk: Over-investment if threat doesn't materialize
- Consequence: Resources diverted, morale affected

IF SETTLEMENT IS RIGHT:
- Preparation should be measured
- Risk: Under-preparation if threat escalates
- Consequence: Casualties and damage if unprepared

IF SPIRITUAL IS RIGHT:
- Physical defense insufficient
- Risk: Magical/spiritual threats underestimated
- Consequence: Defenses fail against magical enemies

ACTUAL CONSEQUENCE:
- All are partially right
- Military threat is real (moderate-escalating)
- Spiritual component is real (magical forces at work)
- Measured response needed (moderate-to-aggressive)
```

**STAKEHOLDERS & POSITIONS**
```
CAPTAIN THORNE (Military Authority):
- Wants: Rapid settlement preparation
- Concern: Delay increases casualty risk

### CONFLICT #5: "GENERATIONAL DIVIDE & TRADITION VS. INNOVATION"
**Status:** EMERGING (background tension)  
**Severity:** LOW (not critical yet)  
**Timeline:** Weeks 4-16 (developing slowly)

**THE CORE ISSUE**
```
QUESTION: Should settlement preserve frontier traditions or modernize?

TRADITION PERSPECTIVE (Older settlers - Torvin, Gareth, Dermot):
- Value: Proven methods, craftsmanship standards, dwarven/human traditions
- Goal: Maintain settlement character, quality, values
- Concern: Innovation dilutes community identity, lowers standards
- Example: Apprenticeships should be personal mentorship, not formal system

INNOVATION PERSPECTIVE (Younger settlers - Fergus, Lyssa, Initiate Thom):
- Value: Efficiency, modern methods, new possibilities
- Goal: Improve settlement operations, efficiency, opportunities
- Concern: Tradition limits growth, efficiency, adaptation
- Example: Formal training systems, written documentation, new techniques
```

**SPECIFIC TENSIONS**
```
TENSION 1: Apprenticeship System
- Tradition: Personal mentorship (Gareth teaching apprentices)
- Innovation: Formal program with curriculum (proposed by some)
- Impact: Knowledge transfer efficiency vs. personal relationship

TENSION 2: Written Records
- Tradition: Oral history, personal knowledge (how Marta stores herbalism)
- Innovation: Document everything (proposed documentation)
- Impact: Knowledge preservation vs. cultural continuity

TENSION 3: New Techniques
- Tradition: Proven methods (Dermot's traditional smithing)
- Innovation: Try new metalworking methods (Fergus's ideas)
- Impact: Stability vs. advancement

TENSION 4: Settlement Governance
- Tradition: Council of elders, informal decisions
- Innovation: Formal written laws, systematic procedures
- Impact: Flexibility vs. clarity, personal vs. bureaucratic

TENSION 5: Gender & Role Expectations
