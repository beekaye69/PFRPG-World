## DETAILED MILE-BY-MILE BREAKDOWN

### SEGMENT 1: ELDRIDGE TO HARROW FAMILY FARM (0.0 – 0.2 miles)

**Starting Location:** Eldridge Market Square  
**Ending Location:** Harrow Family Farm  
**Distance:** 0.2 miles  
**Travel Time:** 4-5 minutes  

**Route Description:**

Leaving Eldridge southward, the urban noise of the market district fades behind you. The paved stone roads give way to packed earth, still well-maintained but clearly rural. Grain warehouses loom to your left (east), their massive storage capacity a testament to the town's agricultural wealth. The road straightens, becoming a clear merchant route marked by regular wagon ruts.

The smell shifts from town woodsmoke and baked goods to open-field air—fresher, carrying the scent of grain crops and livestock. Wind moves across open ground, replacing the muffled sounds of urban activity with bird calls and rustling grain stalks.

On your left (east), organized fields stretch toward the horizon, currently in various states depending on season. On your right (west), more fields with scattered farmsteads in the distance. The ground is level here, making travel easy.

**Travel Time:** 4 minutes  

**Route Description:**

The road continues south, becoming more mixed terrain. The elevation continues rising gradually. Stone-paved sections become dominant over packed earth—this is clearly a well-maintained merchant corridor.

Landscape shifts: you pass through stretches of pure farmland, then areas with small clusters of trees and natural vegetation. The plateau you're on offers good visibility—fields extend in most directions.

As you approach the 0.8-mile mark, a distinctive feature appears: the shrine. Its small stone structure is visible from some distance, marked by a bell tower rising from the roof.

### SEGMENT 5: SHRINE TO BLACKSTONE RAVINE (0.8 – 1.2 miles)

**Distance:** 0.4 miles  
**Travel Time:** 8 minutes  

**Route Description:**

Leaving the shrine, the landscape shifts noticeably. The flat plateau begins descending more obviously. The road becomes less stone-paved, returning to quality packed earth with some stone sections.

Terrain becomes more variable—not quite ravine yet, but the landscape shows more dramatic topography. The road descends in steps rather than a smooth gradient, following the natural landscape.

As you travel this segment, you become aware that this is a transition zone. The cultivated farmland of the first mile gives way to wilder terrain. Vegetation becomes more varied—fewer organized fields, more natural forest patches.

**Elevation:** Descending from 75 ft to 50 ft (ravine edge)

**Topography:** Transition zone; terrain becomes more dramatic toward ravine

**Milestones:**

- Smell: Transition from farm scents to forest air (fresher, less cultivated)
- Touch: Road surface changes from well-paved to more natural
- Temperature: Slightly warmer in valley approaches

**Encounters:**

### SEGMENT 6: BLACKSTONE RAVINE CROSSING (1.2 – 1.3 miles)

**Distance:** 0.1 miles (actual crossing)  
**Travel Time:** 5-7 minutes (normal pace); 10-15 minutes (careful wagon passage)  

**Location: Blackstone Ravine – Goblin Incursion Point**

**Strategic Importance:** Major defensive concern, goblin emergence point, recent battle site, ongoing concern  
**Status:** Actively monitored by militia, known danger point  
**Post-Raid Condition:** Damaged bridge under repair, increased militia vigilance  

**Ravine Formation:**

The land slopes gradually south, then suddenly drops. A gorge opens beneath, roughly 50-70 feet deep, 40-50 feet wide. The ravine runs roughly east-west, perpendicular to the road. Sheer stone walls in places, sloped earth in others.

A creek runs at the bottom: Blackstone Creek, dark water, rushing. The ravine gets its name from the black-gray stone of the walls, distinctive against lighter surrounding terrain.

**Ravine Topography:**
- **Northern edge:** Merchant road approaches carefully
- **Ravine walls:** Mix of sheer stone (gray-black, hence "Blackstone"), loose earth, some vegetation clinging to walls
- **Bottom:** Stream flowing, rocks, some flat areas, cave openings visible in walls
- **Southern edge:** Stone-paved road resumes after careful descent
- **Alternative passages:** None visible; bridge is only practical crossing point

**Bridge: Goblin-Damaged Structure**

**Original:** Substantial stone bridge, medieval construction, similar to Crossfield Creek bridge  
**Recent Damage:** Significant goblin raid damage; stones displaced, one major arch partially collapsed  
**Repair Status:** Militia and volunteers currently patching damage; visible work, scaffolding in place  
**Current Condition:** Usable but damaged; passable for careful travel; wagon traffic slower  
**Repair Timeline:** Expected full repair in 1-2 weeks (from campaign start)

**Bridge Details:**
- Material: Cut stone, same gray-black as ravine walls
- Width: Roughly 15 feet (standard merchant road width)
- Current Status: Northern arch visibly displaced; large stones out of alignment; southern arch damaged but functional
- Repair Work: Militia oversight, volunteer labor, ongoing

**Visual Description:**

The road approaches the ravine carefully—you notice the change in ground level first, slight warning. Then the chasm opens suddenly. The stone bridge spans it—impressive engineering, but clearly hurt. The northern arch is visibly displaced; large stones are out of alignment. Repair work is active—militia oversight, volunteer labor visible.

Beyond the bridge, the road continues south into higher ground, ascending out of the ravine.

**Goblin Evidence:**

The ravine shows signs of goblin habitation:
- Disturbed soil patterns
- Crude marks and symbols on stone
- Discarded materials scattered
- Cave openings in walls (where goblins nested)
- Stone markings visible (ritual scars observed on surfaces; goblin territorial markings)
- It's clear this is their territory—a frontier between civilization and goblin lands

**Sensory Details:**

**Sight:**
- Damaged bridge impressive but wounded
- Deep ravine dramatic drop
- Dark water (Blackstone Creek, ominous-named)
- Goblin signs crude markings, disturbances
- Cave openings dark, mysterious
- Repair work militia presence, ongoing labor
- Stone walls dramatic, sheer in places

**Sound:**

- Militia communication guards coordinating

**Smell:**
- Water-dampness creek moisture, stone-wet
- Goblin presence earthy, unpleasant, distinctive (familiar from post-raid experience)
- Disturbed earth raw soil
- Militia presence leather, oil, human presence

**Touch:**
- Stone cool to touch, slightly damp from spray
- Air movement wind channeled through gap, can feel strong
- Smooth worn stone from frequent crossing

**Temperature:**
- Noticeably cooler ravine acts as cool zone
- Stone thermal mass, water proximity
- Wind is channeled through gap, can feel strong and cold

**Crossing Details:**

**Normal Passage:** 5-7 minutes careful pace, slower than normal bridge crossing due to caution  
**Wagon Passage:** 10-15 minutes, requires careful navigation  
**Safe Passage:** No serious hazard if cautious, but requires attention  
**Slippery Conditions:** After rain, stones become slippery; crossing time increases

**NPCs: Militia Presence**

**Guard Captain Mareck** (Senior Militia at Bridge)
- Personality: Veteran, cautious, responsible for bridge security
- Role: Oversees repair work, checks travelers, maintains ravine monitoring
- Relationship: Knows of Gort's reputation, respectful, might brief on goblin activity

**Militia Presence Summary:**

- Typical: 2-4 militia at bridge during daylight
- Night: Reduced presence; dangerous after dark; travel discouraged
- Post-Raid: Increased vigilance, more frequent patrols

**Goblin Monitoring:**

The ravine is under constant low-level surveillance. Militia scouts check regularly. If Gort travels here, militia will acknowledge him and provide updates on goblin activity.

**Strategic Notes:**

This location is the boundary between civilized trade route and goblin territory. It marks the frontier of safety. South of here, civilization becomes sparser. The ravine is the final major settlement area feature before the wilderness transition.
