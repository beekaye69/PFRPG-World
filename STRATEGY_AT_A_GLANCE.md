## WHY MAGIC [101] & TASKS [102] FIRST?

### Magic System [101]
**Complexity:** 6 spells + free-form + resource management
**Confusion:** Resource limits (2 spells/encounter) confuse players
**Utility:** Used every combat encounter
**Decision Points:** Which spell when? Spell synergies?
**Solution:** Examples show every spell, every scenario

### Task Resolution [102]
**Complexity:** PM discretion creates inconsistency
**Confusion:** Attribute selection not obvious, modifiers unclear
**Utility:** Used constantly (exploration, social, investigation)
**Decision Points:** Which attribute? What's the difficulty?
**Solution:** 40+ examples establish baseline difficulty

## ✨ KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

1. **Magic (28) and Tasks (29) are clear winners**
   - 2-3 points higher than next tier
   - Both are used constantly
   - Both create player confusion without examples
   - Both unlock complete session playability

2. **Each phase builds on previous phases**
   - Phase 2 uses Phase 1 combat knowledge
   - Phase 3 uses Phase 1-2 knowledge
   - Phase 4 uses all previous phases
   - Creates compounding knowledge value

3. **Cross-linking creates multiplier effect**
   - Every new system enhances previous systems
   - Bidirectional references prevent information loss
   - Users benefit from multiple perspectives
   - Knowledge becomes more discoverable

4. **Phased approach is sustainable**
   - Can complete one system per work session
   - Each phase unlocks new capability level
   - Progress is visible and rewarding
   - Quality maintained throughout

5. **Strategic order matters**
   - Magic before Settlements (magic affects encounters)
   - Tasks before NPCs (NPCs make task rolls)
   - Combat before everything (foundation)
   - Optimization last (build on solid fundamentals)
