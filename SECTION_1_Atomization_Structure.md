## CORE MECHANICS ATOMIZATION STRUCTURE

### Section 1: Core Mechanics & Task System (Parent)
**Full Documentation:** `SECTION_1_CoreMechanics_DeepDive.md`

#### Atomic Sub-Sections (1.1–1.7)

| Sub-Section | Title | Scope | Key Concepts | Cross-Links |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1.1** | d6 System Foundation | Die mechanics, comparisons, outcomes | Roll outcomes, probability, no bonuses | 1.2, All sections |
| **1.2** | Task Resolution Framework | 5-step process, difficulty determination | Steps, process flow, context | 1.1, 1.3, All sections |
| **1.3** | Five Difficulty Tiers | Laughable to Very Difficult | Thresholds, success %, when to use | 1.2, All sections |
| **1.4** | Five Core Abilities | Str, Agi, Int, Wis, Cha | Application examples, ability rerolls | 1.2, 1.3, Section 3, Section 4 |
| **1.5** | Heroic Reroll System | Allocation, usage, earning mechanics | Per-session budget, earning via 6→6, strategy | 1.1, All sections |
| **1.6** | Exploding Die Mechanic | Chaining, probability, application | Natural 6 explosions, damage chains | 1.1, 1.5, 2.6 Combat |
| **1.7** | Natural 6 Checks | Mechanics, earning checks, strategic use | When they happen, reroll earning, tactics | 1.5, 1.6, All sections |

## ATOMIZATION PHILOSOPHY

Each atomic file includes:

1. **Rule Summary** (tight, single-concept focus)
2. **Detailed Mechanics** (step-by-step, interactions)
3. **Complex Scenarios** (combinations, edge cases)
4. **Gameplay Examples** (1 simple, 1 complex)
5. **PM Reasoning Examples** (2-3 with adjudication)
6. **Mini FAQ** (3-5 targeted questions)
7. **Decision Matrices** (when-to-use, decision trees)
8. **Cross-Links** (upward, sideways, downward)
9. **Scenario Packs** (optional advanced applications)

## OPTIMAL FILE READING ORDER

**For Learning (First Time):**
1. 1.1 d6 System Foundation
2. 1.2 Task Resolution Framework
3. 1.3 Five Difficulty Tiers
4. 1.4 Five Core Abilities
5. 1.5 Heroic Reroll System
6. 1.6 Exploding Die Mechanic
7. 1.7 Natural 6 Checks

**For Reference (Looking up a concept):**
- Use cross-links in each atomic file
- Consult Quick Reference for one-line lookups
- Consult Core Mechanics Primer for chapter-level overview
