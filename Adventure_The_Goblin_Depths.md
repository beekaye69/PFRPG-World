## 🎯 ADVENTURE STRUCTURE: "THE GOBLIN DEPTHS"

### ACT I: INVESTIGATION & PREPARATION (60 minutes)

**Scene 1: Tavern Rumor Hook (15 min)**

*Setting:* "The Crowned Boar" tavern, morning after legendary raid

Mira greets Gort with free bread and ale: "Hero's breakfast. You've made quite the reputation."

**Rumor Cascade:**
1. Jorik approaches: "Thorne wants to talk to you. He's planning something *big*."
2. Mira slides close: "I heard something strange... goblin scouts mentioning *ritual scars* and *the Deep Father*. Not normal goblin talk."
3. Finn (wagon driver) joins: "Karel's next caravan isn't safe. Something's stirring them up worse."
4. Father Aldus (priest) approaches: "A word of caution, young warrior. The old texts mention... *deep things*. If the goblins are performing rituals..."

**Player Opportunity:**
- Ask for rumor details (Mira has best gossip)
- Visit Captain Thorne immediately
- Recruit Jorik for next adventure
- Research at shrine/library (Father Aldus can reference old goblin histories)

---

**Scene 2: Captain Thorne's War Room (20 min)**

*Setting:* Crossroads militia headquarters

Captain Thorne stands over a rough map, scarred face grim:

"Gort. Good timing. We've got a situation escalating. After your success, we've been tracking goblin movements more carefully. Three days ago, Scout Alys found something..."

**Thorne's Intel:**
- Goblin scouts showing **ritual scarring** (not natural, intentional)
- New coordination/discipline (unusual for goblins)
- Deeper lair entrance discovered (previously unknown)
- Escalation feels imminent (raid volume increasing)
- Strange stone tablets captured (Lynda can't identify origin)

**The Quest Offer:**
"I'm mounting an expedition. Three-day raid: scout Scar Ridge, infiltrate Razgut's stronghold, find what's commanding them. You've proven yourself—15 gold to anyone who volunteers. More if we get answers about the deep lair."

*Alternative:* "Or take Alys as a guide (5gp/day) and scout alone. Bring back intelligence. Thorne will believe your reports and move forward accordingly."

**Available Allies:**
- **Jorik** (wagon driver, axes, +1 morale) - Free (friendship)
- **Alys the Scout** (skilled tracker, ranged, careful) - 5gp/day
- **Militia volunteers** (discipline, numbers) - Part of Thorne's expedition

---

*Location:* Eldridge market / Hrothgar's forge

**Shopping Opportunities:**
- Hrothgar: 20% discount (already established)
  - Leather armor upgrade: 30gp → 24gp (11 AC vs current leather)
  - Better shortbow: 20gp → 16gp
  - Extra arrows: 1gp per dozen
  - Weapon repair: Free to allied hero
  
- Lynda the Herbalist:
  - Healing potion (50gp) → "I'm giving you one, hero. Refuse it and hurt my feelings." (Free gift)
  - Antidote kit (30gp) → Useful if poison involved
  - Supplies for ritual identification (5gp) → Can identify goblin ritual components
  
- Karel (if recruiting for next caravan):

**Character Moments:**

- Mira privately: "Be careful out there. Goblins aren't the only danger..." (Mysterious hint)
- Father Aldus gift: A small blessed amulet (+1 vs *magical effects*, flavor/symbolic)

---

### ACT II: WILDERNESS APPROACH & TRACKING (90 minutes)

**Scene 1: Travel to Goblin Hills (30 min)**

*Route:* Eldridge → Crossroads (40 min with Jorik) → Game Trail south (30 min careful tracking)

**Travel Encounters (Choose 1-2):**

**Option A: Weather Challenge**
- Storm approaching from north
- Narrow ravine passage (muddy, slippery)
- **Challenge:** Navigation check (DC 4) to maintain pace
- **Success:** Quick passage, gain surprise at camp
- **Failure:** Delayed arrival, goblins more alert

**Option B: Scout Encounter**
- Single goblin scout (4 HP, Defense 4, sling)
- He's reporting back to Scar Ridge
- **Combat:** Quick skirmish (1-2 rounds)
- **Capture/Persuade:** Can force information (goblin discipline unusual)
- **Let pass:** Follow stealthily to camp location

**Option C: Jorik's Moment**
- Jorik shares personal story: "My brother died to goblins, three years past. This matters to me."
- **Social moment:** Bond +1 (morale stacks, character depth)
- **Combat prep:** "Let's be smart. I want to *win*, not just fight."

**Tactical Outcome:**
- Party arrives at Scar Ridge approach
- Visibility: High ground overlooking camp
- Element of surprise: Still possible (goblins not expecting organized threat)

---

**Scene 2: Scar Ridge Scout Camp Approach (30 min)**

*Setting:* Rocky hilltop, 40 feet elevation advantage, crude goblin camp below

**Reconnaissance Options:**

**Option 1: Stealth Observation (High Difficulty)**
- Sneak down (Stealth DC 5)
- Observe camp layout, count fighters, note escape route
- Detailed intelligence for assault planning
- **Success:** Learn camp has 12 goblins, 2 taskmasters, Grigg as leader
- **Failure:** Spotted; combat triggers early

**Option 2: Direct Assault (Straightforward)**
- Attack from high ground (advantage)
- 12 Goblin Scouts (4 HP, Defense 4, slings/spears)
- 2 Goblin Taskmasters (5 HP, Defense 5, whips/clubs)
- Grigg the Scarred (6 HP, Defense 5, curved sword, tactical)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (high ground + numbers)

**Option 3: Infiltration Deception**
- Wear goblin gear (from previous kills)
- Attempt to pass as scouts (Deception DC 6, hard)
- Risky but potentially bypass combat
- **Success:** Access camp, steal intelligence, escape
- **Failure:** Combat at disadvantage (surrounded)

**Combat Details (If Direct Assault):**

**Goblin Formation:**
- Scouts: spread around camp perimeter (sling range 40 ft)
- Taskmasters: flanking central area (whip range 30 ft)
- Grigg: last to engage, tactical positioning, uses cover

**Tactical Complication:**
- Ravine escape route (goblins flee if losing badly)
- Ritual scarring visible on all goblins (clue to deeper threat)
- Camp supplies include **stone tablets** (indecipherable symbols)

**Grigg the Scarred (Boss):**
- HP: 6 | Defense: 5 | Attacks: Curved sword (d6+1 piercing)
- Special: Tactical retreat, rally allies, uses cover
- Behavior: Fights until 3 goblins killed, then flees to Razgut's
- Drops: Curved sword (nice weapon), ritual scarring *notes*, map fragment

**Treasure:**
- Camp supplies: 40 gold (looted goods)
- Grigg's personal cache: 30 gold + ritual knife
- Stone tablets: 2 pieces (mysterious, Lynda can try identifying)
- Goblin spears/weapons: (salvageable)

**Narrative Moment:**
If goblins captured alive: "We serve *the Deep Father*. He has *awakened*. You cannot stop what comes." (Terrified but fanatical)

---

**Scene 3: Interrogation / Camp Search (30 min)**

*Location:* Scar Ridge camp, after combat

**Investigation Options:**

**Ritual Scars (New Discovery):**
- All dead goblins have ritual chest scars
- Pattern: Deliberate, carved, possibly magical
- Lynda's later identification: "This is *cult work*. Someone's binding them magically."

**Stone Tablets (Mysterious):**
- Indecipherable symbols (not goblin language)
- Older than goblin occupation
- Fragments suggest: "...AWAKENING... DEEP FATHER... BLOOD RITES..."
- Father Aldus might recognize as "Elder Speech" or "Deep Dweller Magic"

**Camp Layout Intelligence:**
- Map showing route to Razgut's Stronghold (5 miles east, mountainous)
- Supply cache location noted
- Three possible approach routes identified

**Captured/Interrogated Goblin (if any):**
- "Razgut takes orders from *Urg*. Urg speaks to *the Deep One*."
- "The scars bind us. We cannot disobey."
- "Razgut prepares for *the Calling*. Three days, they come from the depths."
- "There are passages... ancient passages... things that sleep..."

**Decision Point:**
- Press on to Razgut's stronghold now? (Night falling, rested condition)
- Return to Crossroads for report and reinforcements? (Safe option)
- Camp here and recover? (Risk of goblin counterattack)

---

### ACT III: RAZGUT'S STRONGHOLD APPROACH & RAID (120 minutes)

**Scene 1: Wilderness Travel to Main Lair (30 min)**

*Route:* Scar Ridge → 5 miles mountainous terrain → Razgut's hilltop stronghold

**Travel Hazards (Choose 1):**

**Option A: Goblin Counterattack**
- Grigg's report brings reinforcements
- 8-10 goblin warriors intercept party (5 HP, Defense 5)
- Tactical: They attack on *their* terrain (advantage goblins)
- **Combat:** Hard (numbers + terrain)
- **Consequences:** Gort's party bloodied before main encounter

**Option B: Scout Discovery**
- Alys spots goblin patrol before they spot party
- **Ambush chance:** Attack from hiding (high advantage)
- 6-8 goblin scouts (4 HP, Defense 4)
- **Tactical:** Party controls engagement (smart scouting)

**Option C: Environmental Hazard**
- Mountain pass narrows dangerously
- Rockslide risk (Athletics DC 4 to avoid)
- **Failure:** Party scattered, resources lost
- **Success:** Safe passage, but tiring climb

**Arrival (Keystone Moment):**
Party crests ridge overlooking Razgut's stronghold. 

*Description:* "Below you spreads a fortified hilltop camp. Crude palisade walls encircle a central collection of leather tents. Smoke rises from a central fire. The entrance to what looks like a *cavern* glows faintly—orange light from within. Guards patrol. You count at least 15-20 goblin fighters visible. And something feels *wrong* about the place. The air tastes like stone and copper."

**Tactical Evaluation:**
- 30-40 goblins total (visible and in tents)
- Razgut is formidable (d6+1, 12 HP)
- Urg the Shaman leads rituals (mysterious powers)
- Cavern entrance heavily guarded (intentional focus)
- Party is outnumbered 5:1 (direct assault = suicide)

---

**Scene 2: Siege Approach Options (60 min)**

Party must choose tactical approach. No single "correct" answer.

**OPTION A: STEALTH INFILTRATION**

*Difficulty:* Very Hard (DC 6 Stealth checks)

**Path:** Sneak around camp perimeter, avoid patrols, observe from inside

**Specific Objectives:**
1. Reach camp interior without detection
2. Observe Urg's ritual (intelligence on "Deep One" connection)
3. Find supply location (grain caches, ritual items)
4. Escape without major combat

**Stealth Sequence:**
- Guard posts (3 locations, 2 goblins each)
- Patrol routes (predictable, 1 goblin every 10 minutes)
- Central fire pit (Razgut + 4 warriors, brightly lit)
- Cavern entrance (2 taskmasters, always watching)

**Consequences:**
- **Success:** Perfect intelligence, escape safely, prepare for next phase
- **Partial Success:** Observed, combat triggers early (tactical advantage still held)
- **Failure:** Major combat, party surrounded, escape route threatened

**Narrative Reward:**
If successful, party witnesses *Urg leading ritual*:

*"A massive goblin in bone vestments stands before the cavern. Other goblins kneel. He chants in a language that hurts to hear. The ground trembles. Voices answer from the *darkness below*—not goblin voices. Older. Deeper. Hungrier. Urg's body glows faintly. The kneeling goblins scream with... ecstasy? Pain? Their scars *shine*."*

**Intelligence Gained:**
- The goblins are *enslaved* (magically bound)
- The "Deep One" is *real* and answering calls
- Ritual happens *every evening* (pattern identified)
- Urg is the *key* to the binding (kill him, goblins lose compulsion)

---

**OPTION B: DIRECT SIEGE / ASSAULT**

*Difficulty:* Hard (outnumbered, but terrain helps)

**Tactical Advantage Points:**
- High ground (if approaching from ridge)
- Surprise (if camp doesn't detect party)
- Speed (focused objective, don't fight entire camp)

**Combat Objectives:**
1. Kill/disable Urg (Shaman, ritual leader)
2. Obtain ritual items (stone tablets, bone vestments)
3. Escape before Razgut's full force engages

**Encounter Design:**
- First Wave: 10 goblin warriors (5 HP, Defense 5) defend camp entrance
- Second Wave: Razgut arrives (12 HP, d6+1, brutal, experienced)
- Urg Intervention: Shaman casts *Bone Curse* spell (deal 1d6 damage to target, magical)

**Razgut the Grim (Boss):**
- HP: 12 | Defense: 5 (leather armor)
- Attacks: War axe (d6+2 slashing, heavy)
- Special: War Cry (+1 attack to allies), tactical positioning
- Behavior: Fights to incapacitate Gort specifically ("Legendary hero")
- Drops: War axe, ritual amulet (magic item), leadership authority

**Urg the Shaman (Mystical Enemy):**
- HP: 7 | Defense: 4
- Attacks: Bone staff (d6 magical, special)
- Spells: *Bone Curse* (1d6 magical damage), *Ritual Binding* (enslaves if HP < 3)
- Special: Can command goblins (enhanced morale)
- Behavior: Stays in ritual space, calls for reinforcements
- Drops: Bone staff (magical focus), ritual notes (reveal Deep One secrets)

**Tactical Complications:**
- Cavern entrance: If Urg reaches it, he descends (escapes)
- Goblin reinforcements: Every 3 rounds, 4-6 more goblins arrive
- Terrain: Palisade walls provide cover for defenders
- Ritual still happening: Ground shaking, visibility reduced

**Outcome:**
- If Urg escapes to cavern: He's alive, ritual incomplete, goblins rally
- If Urg defeated: Goblins lose compulsion, many flee, Razgut fights to death
- If Razgut defeated: Goblins demoralized, easier pursuit

---

**OPTION C: TACTICAL NEGOTIATION (Risky)**

*Difficulty:* Extreme (Deception DC 7 or Intimidate DC 7)

**Setup:** Party reveals presence, demands negotiation

**Razgut's Response:** *"You? One human? You defeated Scar Ridge? Perhaps... you're more dangerous than we thought. What do you want, little hero?"*

**Negotiation Paths:**

1. **Demand Release** - Razgut laughs. "We serve *the Deep Father*. He demands war. Negotiations are for the weak."

2. **Exploit Goblin Resentment** - Can party convince goblins they're *enslaved*? (Very hard)
   - If successful: Goblin uprising, goblins turn on Urg and Razgut
   - If failed: Combat advantage lost, surrounded

3. **Offer Alliance** - "Join us against the Deep Father." (Nearly impossible)
   - Razgut sees this as weakness
   - Only option if party seems unstoppable (rare)

4. **Demand Urg** - "Give us the Shaman, we leave." (Possible compromise)
   - Razgut considers: Urg is valuable, but not irreplaceable
   - If desperate, might offer Urg to buy time
   - Goblins would fight to keep caves secret

**Outcome:** Negotiation only delays combat. Used well, gains intelligence. Used poorly, worse tactical position.

**Scene 3: Camp Aftermath & Cavern Entrance (30 min)**

*Location:* Razgut's stronghold, assuming party has victory

**After-Combat Assessment:**

**If Urg Defeated:**
- Goblins lose magical compulsion
- Many scatter and flee (half force gone)
- Remaining goblins are *terrified* but still present (10-15 stay)
- Ritual bindings break (visible magical effect—scars stop glowing)

**If Urg Escaped to Caverns:**
- Goblins remain enslaved and dangerous
- Ritual continues from depths (trembling intensifies)
- Cavern entrance becomes *active focus* (light brighter, voices louder)
- Party has limited time before reinforcements emerge

**Camp Spoils:**
- Ritual items: Bone vestments, altar pieces, stone tablets (more complete)
- Treasure: 80+ gold (supply cache, Razgut's personal hoard)
- Weapons: War axes, curved swords, goblin-sized armor (1d6 base damage)
- Intelligence: Maps to deeper caves, ritual notes (indecipherable but important)
- Captives (optional): Any prisoners Razgut held (adventure hook)

**The Cavern Entrance (Keystone):**

*The cave mouth glows with orange light. The temperature drops noticeably. From within comes a *sound*—not screams, not voices, but something between. Rhythmic. Hungry. Waiting.*

**Mysteries Revealed:**
- Ancient dwarf stonework visible (older than goblin occupation)
- Ritual altar at entrance (obvious purpose)
- Urg's ritual chamber visible inside (bone decorations, rune circle)
- Sound from *deeper* (something living, immense, patient)

**Intelligence Summary (From Captured Documents/Ritual Notes):**
- "The Deep Father slept for *ages*. Urg's ritual binds goblin blood to his awakening."
- "Seven nights of blood sacrifice. On the eighth, *it rises*."
- "Those marked with the scar are bound. Those bound are *His*."
- "The conquest begins in the depths. The surface will follow."

**Time Pressure Element:**
- Party has approximately *3 days* before "awakening" is complete
- Each day, more goblins arrive from deeper passages
- Ritual continues regardless (needs powerful interruption)
- Reinforcements escalate danger exponentially

---

### ACT IV: RESOLUTION & HOOKS (30 minutes)

**Scene 1: Recovery & Debriefing (15 min)**

*Location:* Razgut's stronghold or Crossroads militia hall

**Party Situation:**
- Bloodied but victorious (assuming successful assault)
- Significant intelligence gathered
- New threats identified (Deep Father, ritual, escalation)
- Magical elements confirmed (not just goblin savagery)

**Debrief with Captain Thorne:**

Thorne listens intently, then stands decisively:

"By the gods. This is worse than we thought. Cult magic. Ancient powers. We need to contact the *other settlements*. Westmarch, Hillstone—they need to know. And..."

*He pauses, looking at the stone tablets.*

"...we need to seal that cavern. Or someone has to go *down* and stop the ritual completely. I won't ask you to do this alone. But I suspect you're the only one who can."

**NPC Responses:**

- **Jorik:** "That cave... that's where my brother probably died. I'm going back in there. With or without the militia."
- **Alys:** "There are *other* caves marked on old maps. Ancient systems. Whatever that thing is, it's been down there for... centuries? Longer?"
- **Father Aldus (when hearing report):** "The texts call it 'the First Hunger.' An ancient thing that feeds on ritual and blood. If it's truly awakening..."
- **Hrothgar (at forge):** "Dwarf stonework in those caves? That's the *Old Hold*. We lost contact with a hold three hundred years ago. Something came from below. Now you're telling me it's alive?"

---

**Scene 2: Reward & Reputation (10 min)**

**Immediate Rewards:**
- Gort gains 80 gold (camp spoils)
- Captain Thorne: 15gp promised bounty (now 50gp total "emergent threat" bonus)
- Jorik: Pledges loyalty for deeper expedition (permanent companion)
- Alys: Offers to scout cave system (if hired, 7gp/day)

**Reputation Effects:**
- Eldridge: "Gort the Goblin-Slayer" → "Gort the Cave-Delver" (upgraded reputation)
- Militia respect escalates (gear loans, favor access)
- News spreads: Westmarch and Hillstone learn of situation (external pressure)
- Tavern fame: Mira spreads Gort's tale (legendary status continues)

**Resources Gained:**
- Complete map of goblin territory (no longer unknown)
- Ritual understanding (dangerous but comprehensible)
- Magical artifacts (bone staff, ritual amulet)
- Permanent allies (Jorik + optional Alys)

---

**Scene 3: Immediate Hooks for Next Session (5 min)**

**Hook 1: The Deeper Descent**
"The ritual continues from the depths. You have perhaps three days before the awakening is complete. The militia can't go down there—the caves are goblin territory, and something *else* lives deeper. You need to decide: assault the underground ritual, seal the caves, or attempt something else entirely."

**Hook 2: Other Settlements**
"News of the threat has reached Westmarch and Hillstone by messenger. They're sending representatives to Crossroads. Politics might demand a larger alliance. You could become the *central figure* in regional defense."

**Hook 3: Ancient Mysteries**
"Hrothgar mentions his dwarven ancestors. There are texts, maps, *weapons* in the Old Hold if it can be accessed. A dwarf expedition is being organized. Gort has proven himself—he'd be welcome."

**Hook 4: Personal Companion**
"Jorik has sworn to follow you into darkness. He's no longer just a wagon driver—he's a *companion* who loves you brotherhood-style. This is a permanent bond."

**Hook 5: The Cost of Victory**
"The ritual bindings on the goblins created a magical dependency. Those scars? They're spreading. You start seeing goblins that *want* to serve the Deep Father, compulsion aside. Some are questioning allegiance. A *splinter goblin faction* might emerge."

## 💬 KEY NPC DIALOGUE & MOTIVATIONS

### Razgut the Grim (Boss)
**Before Combat:**
"You killed my scouts. Now you come to my stronghold? *Foolish*. But perhaps you're worth *his* notice. Perhaps I should bring you to him..."

**During Combat (At 4 HP):**
"Your strength is noted, human. But *he* commands. You cannot fight destiny!"

**If Defeated:**
"No... impossible. *He* promised me victory... *He* promised..." (Dies, confused, not fully in control)

### Urg the Shaman
**During Ritual:**
*Chanting in ancient language, eyes black as night* "The *Hunger* awakens. The *Binding* holds. Blood feeds *Him*. Soon... soon *He* rises..."

**If Confronted:**
"You understand nothing, surface-dweller. We are *chosen*. Our pain is *purpose*. You cannot stop the awakening."

**If Escaped:**
"Cowards! The Deep Father will find you! *There is no escape from his hunger!*"

### Jorik (Companion)
**When Committing to Party:**
"My brother died fighting goblins. I was too young to help. Now... now I can do something. I'm coming with you, Gort. All the way. I swear it."

**In Combat (Morale Check):**
"For my brother! For Eldridge! Let's finish this!"

## 🎬 CINEMATIC MOMENTS & ROLEPLAY BEATS

**Moment 1: "Raid Hero's Return"**
*Tavern scene, morning after legendary raid. Mira's genuine pride, Jorik's respect, town buzz. Gort is becoming *legend*.*

**Moment 2: "The Ritual Witness"**
*If party observes Urg's ritual: The moment of *true horror*. The Deep Father's voice answering. Goblins in ecstasy/agony. Magic is *real*, and it's *ancient*.*

**Moment 3: "Grigg's Last Words"**
*As Grigg the Scarred falls: "You've won the battle, but not the war. The *Awakening* cannot be stopped. Only... witnessed." Cryptic, terrified, absolute.*

**Moment 4: "The Cavern's Hunger"**
*Standing before the glowing cave mouth. The sound from within. The temperature drop. The *feeling* of something vast and ancient waking below. This is bigger than goblins.*

**Moment 5: "Jorik's Vow"**
*Post-combat, both bloodied, victory achieved. Jorik kneels slightly: "I follow you, Gort. Wherever this leads. My oath is sworn."*
