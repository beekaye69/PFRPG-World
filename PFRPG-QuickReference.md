## QUICK REF 17: HOW TO CALCULATE X

### Damage
**Attack Roll - Defense Roll = Damage Dealt**
- Fighter rolls 5, Goblin defends with 2
- Damage = 5 - 2 = 3 hp

### Reroll Probability
**Base d6 = 16.7% per outcome (1 in 6)**
- Average outcome: 3.5 hp/attack
- Natural 6: 17% chance
- Heroic Reroll earning (6→6): 2.8% chance

### Encounter Difficulty
**Monster Count Formula:**
- Roll d6: 1-2 = (party size + half) | 3-5 = (party size + 1) | 6 = (half party size + 1)
- Party of 4: 1-2 = 6 monsters | 3-5 = 5 monsters | 6 = 3 monsters

### HP Needed
**Tank (Fighter):** 10 hp = ~3 rounds vs. d6 damage dealers  
**Support (Bard):** 6 hp = ~2 rounds (fragile, needs position)  
**Healer (Cleric):** 8 hp = ~2.5 rounds + healing output extends party
