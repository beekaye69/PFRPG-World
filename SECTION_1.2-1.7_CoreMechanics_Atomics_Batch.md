# SECTION 1.2: TASK RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK
## Atomic Sub-Section Deep Dive

**Title:** PFRPG Section 1.2: Task Resolution Framework (Atomic Sub-Section)

**Scope:** 5-step process, difficulty determination, context, ability selection

**Related Documents:**
- SECTION_1.1_d6SystemFoundation.md (Foundation: d6 basics)
- SECTION_1.3_DifficultyTiers.md (Related: difficulty in task resolution)
- SECTION_1.4_CoreAbilities.md (Related: ability selection step 1)

**Dependencies:** Section 1.1

**Enables:** Sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, all other sections

---

## RULE SUMMARY

**Every task follows the same 5-step process:**

1. **Identify the Ability** - Which of 5 core abilities applies?
2. **Determine Base Die** - Usually d6, sometimes d6-1/d6-2
3. **Set Difficulty** - What threshold (2+, 3+, 4+, 5+, 6)?
4. **Execute the Roll** - Roll die, check for natural 6
5. **Compare & Resolve** - Roll ≥ Difficulty = Success; Success? → Outcome

---

## DETAILED MECHANICS

### Step 1: Identify the Ability

**The Five Core Abilities:**
- Strength (physical power)
- Agility (speed, precision, balance)
- Intelligence (logic, knowledge, analysis)
- Wisdom (perception, insight, intuition)
- Charisma (social influence, persuasion, charm)

**How to determine which applies:**
- Read task description
- Ask "What does the character need for this task?"
- Pick most relevant ability
- If multiple apply, PM picks (or player can argue)

**Example decisions:**
- Climbing rope: Strength (power) or Agility (balance)? → Usually Agility (balance more important)
- Persuading NPC: Charisma (social) or Intelligence (logic)? → Usually Charisma (emotion vs. logic)
- Solving puzzle: Intelligence (logic) or Wisdom (insight)? → Usually Intelligence (pattern recognition)

### Step 2: Determine Base Die

**Standard:** d6 (roll 1-6)

**Modifications:**
- **Reduced (Disadvantage):** d6-1, d6-2, d6-3 (represents injury, exhaustion, poor conditions)
- **Never increased:** PFRPG has no bonus dice

**Determine by asking:**
- Is character healthy/prepared? → d6
- Is character injured/disadvantaged? → d6-1 or worse
- Are conditions difficult/poor? → d6-1 or adjust difficulty instead

### Step 3: Set Difficulty

**Five Difficulty Tiers:**
- **Laughable (2+):** Trivial, almost guaranteed success
- **Simple (3+):** Routine, likely success
- **Average (4+):** Moderate challenge, 50/50
- **Tough (5+):** Significant challenge, likely failure
- **Very Difficult (6):** Nearly impossible, needs luck/reroll

**Determine by:**
- Task inherent difficulty
- Environmental conditions
- Character preparation

**Modify difficulty by:**
- Creative approach: Lower 1 tier
- Good tools/preparation: Lower 1 tier
- Poor conditions: Raise 1 tier
- Time pressure: Raise 1 tier
- Hostile opposition: Raise 1 tier

### Step 4: Execute the Roll

- Roll d6 (or d6-1, d6-2, etc. if applicable)
- Record result
- **Check for natural 6:** If rolled exactly 6, check for Heroic Reroll earning (see Section 1.7)
- Note any rerolls available (Heroic, ability)

### Step 5: Compare & Resolve

**Compare roll to difficulty threshold:**
- Roll ≥ Difficulty → **SUCCESS**
- Roll < Difficulty → **FAILURE**

**Apply consequences:**
- Success: Describe positive outcome
- Failure: Describe failure consequence (can vary by situation)

**Optional:** Use Heroic Reroll if available to reroll unfavorable result

---

## COMPLEX SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Task Resolution with Multiple Valid Abilities

**Situation:** Fighter trying to intimidate a merchant to give better price

**Question:** Should this be Strength (intimidating physically) or Charisma (social pressure)?

**Analysis:**
- Strength-based intimidation: Physical threat
- Charisma-based intimidation: Social pressure, manipulation
- Both valid interpretations

**PM Decision:** PM picks ONE (or player argues for specific approach)

**Example rulings:**
- PM says "Charisma" (default for intimidation)
- Fighter argues: "I loom over merchant menacingly" (physical presence)
- PM may allow Strength instead (player creative approach)
- Either way: ONE ability used, not both

**Lesson:** PM arbitrates ability choice to keep system simple

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Simple Task (Happy Path)

**Setup:** Cleric attempting to remember a prayer (Intelligence task, Average 4+)

**Process:**
1. **Identify Ability:** Intelligence (knowledge)
2. **Base Die:** d6 (character uninjured, rested)
3. **Difficulty:** Average (4+) (common prayer, reasonable memory)
4. **Roll:** d6 = 5
5. **Compare:** 5 ≥ 4? YES
6. **Result:** **SUCCESS** "You recall the prayer perfectly"

---

### Example 2: Complex Task (Multiple Modifiers)

**Setup:** Thief picking locked chest while guards patrol outside (Agility task)

**Context:** Thief is wounded, haslock-picking tools, guards might return soon

**Process:**
1. **Identify Ability:** Agility (precision for locks)
2. **Base Die:** d6-1 (wounded reduces die)
3. **Difficulty:** Starts Average (4+), but...
   - Has tools: Would reduce to Simple (3+), but...
   - Time pressure (guards): Raises back to Tough (5+)
   - **Final:** Tough (5+)
4. **Roll:** d6-1 = 3
5. **Compare:** 3 ≥ 5? NO
6. **Result:** **FAILURE** "You hear footsteps—guards coming! You must leave now or hide"

---

## PM REASONING EXAMPLES

### PM Reasoning Example 1: "The player wants to use an ability I didn't expect"

**Situation:**
- Fighter trying to escape ropes (you planned Strength task)
- Fighter says: "I use my training to slip out (Agility instead)"

**PM Reasoning:**
- Valid point—flexibility vs. structure
- Could be Strength (breaking) or Agility (slipping)
- Both reasonable; PM arbitrates

**Ruling:**
- If player has good reason (training, description), allow Agility
- If trying to avoid difficult Strength check, keep Strength
- **Decision:** Allow Agility (player was creative), set Tough (5+) difficulty

---

## MINI FAQ

**Q: Can I choose my own ability?**  
A: PM sets the ability based on task. You can argue for different ability if your approach justifies it. PM has final say.

**Q: What if I want to use Wisdom when Intelligence seems right?**  
A: Possible if your approach justifies it. "I read the room's emotions instead of analyzing" could work. PM decides.

**Q: Do I get to know the difficulty before rolling?**  
A: Typically no. You roll, then PM reveals outcome. This keeps uncertainty real. Some PMs announce difficulty first (house rule).

**Q: Can a task have NO difficulty modifier?**  
A: No. Every task has a difficulty. Trivial tasks are Laughable (2+), not "no check." PM always sets one.

---

## DECISION MATRIX

### How to Set Difficulty as PM

| Task Description | Base Difficulty | Modify Up? | Modify Down? | Final |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Routine task, good conditions | Average (4+) | No | No | Average (4+) |
| Routine task, poor conditions | Average (4+) | +1 tier | No | Tough (5+) |
| Routine task, great tools | Average (4+) | No | -1 tier | Simple (3+) |
| Significant challenge | Tough (5+) | Yes? | -1 tier? | Tough (5+) or Avg |
| Nearly impossible | Very Diff (6) | Rarely | -1 tier? | Tough (5+) or VD |

---

## MODIFICATION GUIDANCE

### Lower Difficulty (Make Easier)

**Reduce by 1 tier when:**
- Creative approach used
- Appropriate tools available
- Preparation done
- Favorable conditions
- Character trained specifically

**Examples:**
- Average (4+) → Simple (3+)
- Tough (5+) → Average (4+)

---

### Raise Difficulty (Make Harder)

**Raise by 1 tier when:**
- Hostile opposition
- Time pressure
- Poor conditions
- Injury/fatigue
- Distraction/danger

**Examples:**
- Average (4+) → Tough (5+)
- Simple (3+) → Average (4+)

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Difficulty Modification in Practice

**Base Task:** Crossing icy bridge (Tough 5+)

**Scenario A (With Help):**
- Ally holds rope
- Environmental advantage
- Lower: Tough (5+) → Average (4+)

**Scenario B (Crisis):**
- Bridge collapsing
- Time pressure
- Raise: Tough (5+) → Very Difficult (6)

**Scenario C (Preparation):**
- Character studies bridge 10 minutes
- Preparation advantage
- Lower: Tough (5+) → Average (4+)

---

## PM REASONING EXAMPLES

### PM Reasoning Example 1: "Between two difficulty tiers, which do I pick?"

**Situation:** Task seems between Average (4+) and Tough (5+)

**PM Reasoning:**
- If task feels 60% likely to succeed → Average (4+)
- If task feels 40% likely to succeed → Tough (5+)
- When uncertain, use Average (4+) as default

**Ruling:**
- Start with Average (4+)
- Modify up/down based on circumstances
- Tiebreaker: Average is safer choice

---

## MINI FAQ

**Q: Can I modify difficulty mid-roll?**  
A: Not after roll is made. Set difficulty before rolling.

**Q: Can I modify difficulty after knowing the PC's approach?**  
A: Yes. If PC describes creative solution, you can lower difficulty before roll.

**Q: What's the hardest task (beyond Very Difficult 6)?**  
A: Very Difficult (6) is max. Impossible tasks simply can't be attempted.

---

## DECISION MATRIX: When to Use Each Tier

| Situation | Tier | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Trivial, no challenge | Laughable (2+) | Picking up item |
| Routine, minimal challenge | Simple (3+) | Climbing stairs |
| Moderate challenge | Average (4+) | Climbing rope |
| High challenge | Tough (5+) | Scaling wall |
| Heroic/desperate | Very Difficult (6) | Impossible jump |

# SECTION 1.4: FIVE CORE ABILITIES
## Atomic Sub-Section Deep Dive

**Title:** PFRPG Section 1.4: Five Core Abilities (Atomic Sub-Section)

**Scope:** Ability definitions, applications, reroll mechanics, stat system

**Related Documents:**
- SECTION_3_CharacterClasses_DeepDive.md (Class abilities use core abilities)
- SECTION_4_CharacterRaces_DeepDive.md (Racial traits use abilities)
- PFRPG-QuickReference.md (Ability quick reference)

**Dependencies:** Section 1.2

**Enables:** Sections 3, 4, all others

---

## RULE SUMMARY

**Five core abilities represent character strengths. Each character has 1-3 stat in each ability (1=weak, 3=excellent). Ability stats affect ability rerolls (not raw rolls).**

| Ability | Used For | Stat Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Strength** | Physical power, forcing, lifting | Who's naturally strong |
| **Agility** | Speed, precision, balance | Who's naturally quick |
| **Intelligence** | Logic, knowledge, analysis | Who's naturally smart |
| **Wisdom** | Perception, insight, intuition | Who's naturally insightful |
| **Charisma** | Social influence, persuasion | Who's naturally charming |

---

---

## ABILITY STATS (1-3 Range)

**Stat meaning:**
- 1: Weak at this ability
- 2: Average at this ability
- 3: Excellent at this ability

**Important:** Stats do NOT add to rolls. They only enable certain reroll types.

**Example:**
- Fighter Strength 3 vs. Strength 1
- On Strength task, both roll d6 (same)
- Difference: Strength 3 might have Muscle ability reroll, Strength 1 might not
- Same baseline roll, but reroll advantage

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Ability Selection

**Scenario:** Thief trying to hide from guards in dark alley

**Question:** What ability?

**Analysis:**
- Agility (sneaking, stealth) - Primary choice
- Wisdom (noticing good hiding spot) - Secondary

**Resolution:**
- PM says: "Agility check (4+)"
- Thief rolls d6-1 (any modifiers) against 4+
- Success: Successfully hidden

---

## PM REASONING EXAMPLES

### PM Reasoning Example 1: "Which ability for this vague task?"

**Situation:**
- Wizard wants to "figure out what the NPC is planning"
- Could be Intelligence (analysis) or Wisdom (reading emotions)

**PM Reasoning:**
- Intelligence: Analytical approach, detective work
- Wisdom: Intuitive reading of person

**Ruling:**
- Ask player: "How do you figure this out?"
- If analytical: Intelligence
- If intuitive: Wisdom
- Player choice (PM arbitrates reasonableness)

---

## MINI FAQ

**Q: Do ability stats give bonuses to rolls?**  
A: No. Stats don't modify rolls. They enable ability rerolls (separate resource).

**Q: Can I use multiple abilities on one task?**  
A: No. PM picks one ability per task. You could argue for different, PM decides.

**Q: Why are there 5 abilities?**  
A: Covers physical (Str, Agi), mental (Int, Wis), and social (Cha) dimensions.

# SECTION 1.5: HEROIC REROLL SYSTEM
## Atomic Sub-Section Deep Dive

**Title:** PFRPG Section 1.5: Heroic Reroll System (Atomic Sub-Section)

**Scope:** Allocation, usage mechanics, earning via natural 6, strategy, resource management

**Related Documents:**
- SECTION_1.1_d6System.md (Uses d6)
- SECTION_1.6_ExplodingDie.md (Earning mechanism via 6→6)
- PFRPG-QuickReference.md (Quick lookup)

**Dependencies:** Section 1.1

**Enables:** Sections 1.6, 1.7, all others

---

## RULE SUMMARY

**Heroic Reroll is a once-per-session resource that lets you reroll any die roll and take the better result.**

**Default Allocation:** 1 per session

**Increases:**
- Human racial trait: +1 (total 2)
- Amulet of Legends (item): +2 (total 3)
- Combined maximum: 4 per session

**Usage:** Spend 1, reroll any die, take new result (even if worse)

**Earning:** Roll natural 6 → PM says "roll for reroll" → Roll d6 again → If 6, earn 1 back

---

## DETAILED MECHANICS

### Starting Allocation

**Base:** 1 Heroic Reroll per session

**Racial Bonuses:**
- Human: +1 (total 2)

**Item Bonuses:**
- Amulet of Legends: +2 (total 3)
- Nether Band: +1 (total 2)

**Combined:** Human + Amulet + Nether = 4 total per session

---

### Using a Heroic Reroll

**When you can use it:**
- On any die roll (task, combat, spell)
- Before or after seeing result (usually after)
- Only once per roll

**Process:**
1. Say "I use Heroic Reroll"
2. Spend 1 from your pool
3. Roll die again
4. Take the new result (binding)

**Note:** Can't reroll a Heroic Reroll. The reroll result is final.

---

### Earning Heroic Rerolls Back

**Trigger:** Roll natural 6 on any roll

**Process:**
1. You roll d6 = 6 (natural 6)
2. PM says "Check for Heroic Reroll"
3. You roll d6 again
4. If result = 6: Earn 1 Heroic Reroll (replenish pool)
5. If result ≠ 6: No reward

**Probability:** 1 in 36 chance (2.8%)

**Example:**
- Roll attack damage: Natural 6
- PM: "Roll for Heroic Reroll"
- Reroll d6 = 2
- No reward (wasn't 6)

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Basic Heroic Reroll Usage

**Setup:** Fighter in combat, needs to hit difficult target, rolls poorly

**Situation:**
- Fighter rolls attack: d6 = 2
- Target defends well
- Fighter has 1 Heroic Reroll

**Decision:**
- Fighter: "I use Heroic Reroll"
- Reroll: d6 = 5
- Result: 5 damage dealt (instead of 2)

---

### Example 2: Heroic Reroll Earning

**Setup:** Wizard casting spell in combat

**Situation:**
- Wizard rolls spell damage: d6-2 = 6 (natural 6!)
- PM: "Check for Heroic Reroll"
- Wizard rolls d6 for earning = 6 (lucky!)
- Wizard earns 1 Heroic Reroll back

---

## PM REASONING EXAMPLES

### PM Reasoning Example 1: "Can they use Heroic Reroll retroactively?"

**Situation:**
- Roll made 5 minutes ago
- Player now wants to use Heroic Reroll
- Roll has already been acted on

**PM Reasoning:**
- Retroactive rerolls create narrative problems
- Once resolved, can't go back
- **Exception:** If roll hasn't been played out yet (PM discretion)

**Ruling:**
- Generally NO retroactive rerolls
- Encourage player to use in moment
- Allow once if genuinely forgot

---

## MINI FAQ

**Q: How many Heroic Rerolls do I start with?**  
A: 1, plus any racial bonuses (Human +1) or items (Amulet +2).

**Q: Can I save Heroic Rerolls across sessions?**  
A: No. Resets each session. They're a once-per-session resource.

**Q: Can I use Heroic Reroll on a Heroic Reroll?**  
A: No. You can't reroll a reroll. The reroll is final.

---

## DECISION MATRIX: When to Use Heroic Reroll

| Situation | Use? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Important combat, low roll | YES | Increases chance to hit |
| Crucial death save | YES | Might save character |
| Boss fight critical moment | YES | Leverage resource for drama |
| Early exploration, minor task | NO | Save for critical moments |
| Already high roll (5+) | NO | Waste; roll likely succeeds |

# SECTION 1.6: EXPLODING DIE MECHANIC
## Atomic Sub-Section Deep Dive

**Title:** PFRPG Section 1.6: Exploding Die Mechanic (Atomic Sub-Section)

**Scope:** Natural 6 chaining, damage accumulation, probability, application, interaction with Combat Master

**Related Documents:**
- SECTION_1.1_d6System.md (d6 foundation)
- SECTION_1.7_Natural6Checks.md (Related: natural 6 triggers explosions)
- SECTION_2.6_AttackResolution.md (Combat application)
- SECTION_3_CharacterClasses_DeepDive.md (Fighter Combat Master)

**Dependencies:** Section 1.1

---

## RULE SUMMARY

**When you roll a natural 6 (exactly 6) on a damage roll, you "explode" and roll another d6. Add results together. If you roll another 6, roll again. Continue until you roll 1-5, then stop.**

**Formula:**
```
6 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 16 total damage
(Exploded 3 times before rolling 4)
```

---

## DETAILED MECHANICS

### Basic Explosion

**Trigger:** Roll d6 for damage, get exactly 6

**Process:**
1. You rolled 6 (count this)
2. Roll another d6
3. Add to total
4. If this roll = 6, roll again
5. If this roll = 1-5, stop

**Example Chain:**
- Roll 1: 6 (explosion!)
- Roll 2: 5 (stop)
- Total: 6 + 5 = 11 damage

---

### Multi-Explosion Chain

**Probability:** Each 6 triggers another roll

**Extreme example:**
- Roll 1: 6 (explosion!)
- Roll 2: 6 (explosion again!)
- Roll 3: 6 (explosion again!)
- Roll 4: 3 (stop)
- Total: 6 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 21 damage

---

### When Explosions Occur

**Explosions happen on:**
- Combat attack damage rolls (damage = attack CS roll)
- Spell damage rolls
- Special ability damage rolls

**Explosions do NOT occur on:**
- Task difficulty checks (you succeed/fail, no explosion)
- Defense rolls (defenders don't explode)
- Heroic Reroll check rolls (the secondary d6 after natural 6)
- Non-damage rolls

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Simple Explosion

**Setup:** Fighter attacks Goblin with sword (d6 damage roll)

**Combat:**
- Fighter rolls attack CS d6 = 6 (natural 6!)
- Explosion check triggered
- Rolls d6 again = 3 (stops)
- Total damage: 6 + 3 = 9 hp

---

### Example 2: Multi-Explosion Chain

**Setup:** Fighter using Combat Master ability (additional d6 roll on attack)

**Combat:**
- Fighter rolls attack CS d6 = 6 (natural 6!)
- Explosion: Roll d6 = 6 (explodes again!)
- Explosion: Roll d6 = 6 (explodes again!)
- Explosion: Roll d6 = 2 (stops)
- Total damage: 6 + 6 + 6 + 2 = 20 hp (massive!)

---

## PM REASONING EXAMPLES

### PM Reasoning Example 1: "Do I roll explosions immediately or let player?"

**Situation:**
- Combat happening
- Natural 6 rolled for damage
- PM unsure who rolls the explosion die

**PM Reasoning:**
- Either PM or player can roll (both work)
- Recommend: Let player roll (more exciting)
- But PM can handle all rolls for speed

**Ruling:**
- **Player rolls explosion die:** More engaging, player owns the moment
- **PM rolls:** Faster, useful if PM controlling monsters

---

## MINI FAQ

**Q: Can spells explode?**  
A: Yes. Any damage roll (spell, ability, attack) can explode on natural 6.

**Q: Do magical items affect explosions?**  
A: No. Explosions are automatic on natural 6; items don't modify this.

**Q: What's the theoretical maximum explosion chain?**  
A: Theoretically infinite, but practically: 6+6+6+6+1 = 25 is very lucky. Most chains 2-3 rolls.

# SECTION 1.7: NATURAL 6 CHECKS
## Atomic Sub-Section Deep Dive

**Title:** PFRPG Section 1.7: Natural 6 Checks (Atomic Sub-Section)

**Scope:** Natural 6 mechanics, Heroic Reroll earning, strategic use, narrative significance

**Related Documents:**
- SECTION_1.5_HeroicReroll.md (Earning mechanism)
- SECTION_1.6_ExplodingDie.md (Explosion mechanic)
- PFRPG-QuickReference.md (Quick lookup)

**Dependencies:** Sections 1.1, 1.5, 1.6

---

## RULE SUMMARY

**Whenever you roll a natural 6 on any d6 roll, two things happen:**

1. **Immediate Effect:** Apply damage explosion or succeed spectacularly
2. **Heroic Reroll Check:** Roll d6 again; if you roll 6, earn 1 Heroic Reroll

**Formula:**
```
Natural 6 → Check for Reroll
Roll d6 for earning → 6? → Earn 1 Heroic Reroll back
```

---

## DETAILED MECHANICS

### What "Natural 6" Means

- Roll a d6 and it lands on exactly 6
- Not modified, not through calculation—actual die roll of 6
- Immediate effect depends on context

### Natural 6 Effects by Context

**In Combat (Damage roll):**
- 6 damage minimum
- Explosion triggered (roll again, add)

**In Tasks (Skill check):**
- Task succeeds (6 always meets any threshold)
- No additional effect

**In Magic (Spell damage):**
- 6 damage minimum
- Explosion triggered

**In Heroic Reroll check (the secondary roll):**
- If 6: Earn Heroic Reroll
- If 1-5: No reward (reroll result final)

---

### Heroic Reroll Earning Process

**Step 1: Roll natural 6 (on any roll)**
- Combat attack: 6 damage
- Task check: 6 on d6
- Spell: 6 damage
- PM says: "Check for Heroic Reroll"

**Step 2: Roll d6 for earning check**
- You roll secondary d6
- Trying to get 6

**Step 3: Results**
- If you roll 6: Earn 1 Heroic Reroll (replenish pool)
- If you roll 1-5: No reward

**Probability:** 1/6 chance (16.7%) per natural 6

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Natural 6 in Combat

**Setup:** Thief attacking Orc with sword

**Combat:**
- Thief rolls attack CS d6-1 = 6 (natural 6!)
- PM: "Explode! Roll for reroll earning!"
- Damage explosion: Roll d6 = 4
- Total damage: 6 + 4 = 10 hp
- Reroll earning: Roll d6 = 3 (not 6, no reward)

---

### Example 2: Natural 6 Earning Heroic Reroll

**Setup:** Wizard casting spell

**Combat:**
- Wizard rolls spell damage d6-2 = 6 (natural 6!)

## MINI FAQ

**Q: Do I always roll for Heroic Reroll earning?**  
A: Yes. Every natural 6 gets an earning check (though only 16.7% succeed).

**Q: Can I use Heroic Reroll on the earning check?**  
A: No. The earning check roll is final; can't reroll it.

**Q: What if I already have max Heroic Rerolls (4)?**  
A: You already have 4, so you don't need more. Earning check still happens, but reward wasted (you're already at cap).
