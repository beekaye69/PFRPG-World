## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Issue: Files won't upload
**Solution:**
1. Check file format (should be .md)
2. Verify file size reasonable
3. Check AnythingLLM storage limits
4. Try uploading smaller batch

### Issue: Indexing takes too long
**Solution:**
1. Normal for large batch (400k words)
2. Upload in phases (Phase 1 → 2 → 3)
3. Monitor system resources
4. Patient waiting is key

### Issue: Query results poor quality
**Solution:**
1. Ensure all phases uploaded
2. Force re-indexing
3. Try more specific query
4. Check cross-linking

### Issue: Missing information
**Solution:**
1. Verify all 60+ files uploaded
2. Check file organization
3. Confirm no truncated files
4. Review Phase 3 status
