## ITEM COMPARISON SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: "What's Better - Focus or Deflect?"
**Focus (Offense):**
- Guaranteed 6 damage
- Can explode with Combat Master
- Limited uses (1-3 per encounter)
- Scales with number of attacks

**Deflect (Defense):**
- Guaranteed 6 blocking
- Can't explode (no explosion mechanic for defense)
- Limited uses (1-3 per encounter)
- Helps entire team (party enemy focus)

**Answer:** Depends on playstyle. Offense-focused? Focus. Defensive-focused? Deflect. Balanced team? Split both.

---

### Scenario 2: "What Ring Should I Get?"
**If you want:** Damage reduction → Ring of Protection  
**If you want:** Perception → Ring of Senses  
**If you want:** Initiative → Ring of Speed  
**If you want:** Magic resistance → Band of Demons or Nether Band

---

### Scenario 3: "What Necklace Should I Get?"
**Best Overall:** Amulet of Legends (+2 Heroic Rerolls/session, bonds to you)  
**Best for Support:** Amulet of Sun God (auto-healing post-encounter, bonds)  
**Best for Utility:** Amulet of Void (move through obstacles, mobility)  
**Best for Summoners:** Necklace of Damned (summon shadow 1/session)

## FAQ: ITEMS

**Q: Can I wear multiple Focus weapons?**
A: Yes. Focus x1 = 1 use/encounter. Focus x2 = 2 uses/encounter. Stack on same weapon type or different weapons.

---

**Q: Do jewelry bonuses stack?**
A: Yes, but only 2 rings + 1 necklace provide benefits. If you wear 3 rings, only 2 work.

---

**Q: Can I craft magical items myself?**
A: With PM approval and a blacksmith NPC, yes. Need 3 Arcane Gems + base weapon/armor.

---

**Q: Can potions be used in combat?**
A: Yes. Taking potion doesn't consume an action (PM discretion, typically happens outside action economy).

---

**Q: What's the most valuable item?**
A: Potion of Ultimate Healing (500 gp). Most common: Magical x1 items (750 gp).

---

**Q: Can items be stolen or lost?**
A: PM discretion. Usually items stick with character unless explicit loss (being disarmed, trap takes item, etc.).

---

**Q: Do bonding necklaces prevent switching?**
A: Yes. Bonded items are locked to that character once bonded. Switch requires unbonding (PM process).

---

**Q: Can I sell items back?**
A: PM discretion. Usually not (items found in dungeon aren't fenceable). Crafted items might be.

## ITEM OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Specialization Over Spreading
Focus on 1-2 optimized items rather than spreading purchases thin.

### Principle 2: Class Synergy Matters
Fighter with Focus? Excellent (Combat Master synergy). Wizard with Focus? Okay (no synergy). Choose wisely.

### Principle 3: Party Composition Affects Item Value
Single tank? Deflect valuable. Multiple damage dealers? Focus valuable. Support heavy? Necklaces valuable.

### Principle 4: Upgrade Path Exists
Runic Forge lets you upgrade x1 → x2. Plan upgrade path when possible.
