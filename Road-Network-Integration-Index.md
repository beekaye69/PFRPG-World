**Surface Variations:**
- **Primary routes:** Mixed stone-paved and packed earth
- **Secondary routes:** Primarily packed earth, some stone sections
- **Frontier routes:** Variable; primarily packed earth and cleared paths

**Maintenance Standards:**

| Primary (East Road) | Well-maintained | Shared | Daily |
| Major (Northern Trade Road) | Well-maintained | Shared | 2-3x weekly |
| Secondary (Western Branch, Spur) | Good condition | Shared | Weekly |
| Frontier (Southern Route) | Irregular | Frontier | Irregular |

### Seasonal Impact Modifiers

**Summer:** Baseline (optimal conditions)  
**Autumn:** Baseline (good conditions)  
**Winter:** +50-100% travel time (ice, snow, hazards)

## WEATHER & ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

### Water Crossing Hazards

| Crossing | Road | Hazard Level | Seasonal Risk | Status |
|----------|------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Crossfield Creek Bridge | East Road | Low | Spring elevated | Safe, maintained |
| Blackstone Ravine Bridge | East Road | High | Spring/Winter | Damaged, post-raid repair |
| Millbrook Stream | East/nearby | Low | Minimal | Functional |
| Multiple streams | Northern Route | Low-Medium | Spring | Variable |
| Regional streams | Western/Spur | Low | Minimal | Safe |

### Primary Hazard Zones

1. **Blackstone Ravine (East Road, 1.2 mi)**
   - Hazard: Goblin territory boundary, goblin scouts, damaged bridge, complex terrain
   - Mitigation: Militia checkpoint, repair work ongoing
   - Safety Level: Medium (daytime safer than night)
   - Recommendation: Travel in daylight, avoid lingering

2. **Goblin Hills Approach (Southern Route, 3.0 mi)**
   - Hazard: Goblin activity, frontier wilderness, limited militia presence
   - Mitigation: Militia outposts, scout reports
   - Safety Level: Medium-High (adventure location)
   - Recommendation: Experienced travelers only; militia coordination suggested

3. **Wilderness Transitions (Spur & Western routes, 3-4 mi)**
   - Hazard: Wildlife, weather exposure, reduced civilization
   - Mitigation: Established paths, regular traffic
   - Safety Level: Low-Medium (manageable for standard travelers)
   - Recommendation: Standard precautions adequate

## TRAVEL TIME & OPTIMIZATION

### Movement Speed Reference

**Standard Walking Speed:** ~3 mph (20 minutes per mile)  
**Wagon/Cart Speed:** ~2 mph (30 minutes per mile)  
**Stealth/Tracking Speed:** ~1.5 mph (40 minutes per mile)

### Multi-Day Journey Planning

**Eldridge to Kilhel (10.5 miles combined):**
- Option 1: East→North route (2+8 mi)
  - Fast: 3.5 hrs walk + 5.5 hrs = ~9 hours (full day)
  - Wagon: 65 min + 5.5 hrs = ~6.5 hours
  - Recommended: Break at Crossroads (2 mi = 40 min walk)

- Option 2: West→Spur route (via Tiny Stump) (4.5+5.5 mi)
  - Fast: 2 hrs + 2.5 hrs = ~4.5 hours
  - Less direct but passes through Tiny Stump

**Optimal Rest Stops:**
- East Road: Wayfarers Rest (0.8 mi) or Blackstone Ravine checkpoint (1.2 mi)
- Northern Route: Farmstead Zone (2 mi) or Gateway (4 mi)
- Western Branch: Farmland Zone (1.5 mi)
- Kilhel Spur: Mid-Route Trading Post (2.5 mi)

### Travel Time Matrix (in minutes)

```
            Eldridge  Crossroads  Kilhel  Tiny Stump
Eldridge      0          40        240       120
Crossroads    40          0         210       150
Kilhel        240         210        0        300+
Tiny Stump    120         150        300+      0
```

*Times in minutes walking pace; wagon times add ~50%*

## MERCHANT CARAVAN SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### Caravan Traffic Patterns (Planned)

**Regular Routes:**

- **2-3 day cycle:** Western Branch (Eldridge ↔ Tiny Stump) – mixed traffic
- **Variable:** Kilhel Spur (triangular optimization)
- **Weekly:** Southern Route (militia supply runs, adventurer outfitting)

**Caravan Integration Points:**
- Each route will have defined waystation positions
- Caravan NPCs integrate with settlements
- Dynamic encounters based on caravan schedules
- Supply availability tied to caravan traffic
