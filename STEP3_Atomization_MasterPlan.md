## PROCESS FOR ATOMIZATION

For each section:

1. **Identify sub-sections** (list what logical chunks exist)
2. **Create navigation file** (like SECTION_2_Atomization_Structure.md)
3. **Create atomic files** with full template:
   - Rule Summary
   - Detailed Mechanics
   - Gameplay Examples (1 simple, 1 complex)
   - PM Reasoning Examples (2-3)
   - Mini FAQ (3-5 questions)
   - Decision Matrices
   - Cross-Links
   - Scenario Packs (optional)

4. **Cross-link all files** to macro, section, and other atomics
5. **Quality check** for consistency, completeness, clarity

---

## CROSS-LINKING STRATEGY

Each atomic file should have:

- **Upward:** Link to section-level deep dive
- **Upward:** Link to macro-level overview (if applicable)
- **Sideways:** Link to related atomics in same section
- **Sideways:** Link to related atomics in different sections
- **Downward:** Link to supporting docs (classes, items, etc.)

Example for Atomic 2.1 (Initiative):
- **Up:** SECTION_2_CombatSystem_DeepDive.md
- **Up:** PFRPG-CombatPrimer.md
- **Sideways:** SECTION_2.2, SECTION_2.3
- **Down:** SECTION_3 (Ranger Alert), SECTION_6 (Ring of Speed)

---

## QUALITY CHECKLIST FOR EACH ATOMIC

Before marking complete:

- ✅ Rule summary is tight and clear
- ✅ Detailed mechanics explain step-by-step
- ✅ At least 2 gameplay examples (simple + complex)
- ✅ At least 2-3 PM reasoning examples
- ✅ Mini FAQ answers common questions
- ✅ Decision matrix or when-to-use guidance
- ✅ All cross-links are filled in
- ✅ Format consistent with Section 2 template
- ✅ No internal contradictions
- ✅ Examples are concrete and grounded in rules

---

## NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ✅ Section 2 Combat atomization complete + template established
2. ⏳ Create Section 1 (Core Mechanics) atomization (7 files)
3. ⏳ Create Section 3 (Character Classes) atomization (7 files)

### Next Session(s)
4. Create Section 4 (Races) atomization (5 files)
5. Create Section 10 (Character Creation) atomization (7 files)
6. Create remaining sections 5-9, 11-12 (32+ files)

### Afterwards
7. Run comprehensive cross-linking pass
8. Create final Index/Navigation Hub
9. Package for AnythingLLM ingestion

---

## FINAL DELIVERABLE

Upon completion of Step 3 (Atomization):

- **Section 2:** 1 navigation file + 9 atomic files (✅ DONE)
- **Section 1:** 1 navigation file + 7 atomic files
- **Section 3:** 1 navigation file + 7 atomic files
- **Section 4:** 1 navigation file + 5 atomic files
- **Section 5:** 1 navigation file + 5-8 atomic files
- **Section 6:** 1 navigation file + 6 atomic files
- **Section 7:** 1 navigation file + 6 atomic files
- **Section 8:** 1 navigation file + 7 atomic files
- **Section 9:** 1 navigation file + 5 atomic files
- **Section 10:** 1 navigation file + 7 atomic files
- **Section 11:** 1 navigation file + 6 atomic files
- **Section 12:** 1 navigation file + 7 atomic files

**Total:** ~100 files, 300-400k words, fully cross-linked, optimally organized for LLM deployment
