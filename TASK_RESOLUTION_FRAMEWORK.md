## 📖 CORE TASK MECHANICS (From PFRPG Rulebook)

### What Is a Task?
Any action requiring a roll that isn't combat.
- Climbing a rope
- Persuading a guard
- Finding a secret door
- Breaking down a door
- Swimming across river
- Solving a puzzle
- Detecting a lie

### Task Roll Formula
```
Your Attribute Roll (CS die) - Modifiers = Task Result
PM's Difficulty Target = Success or Failure
```

**Example:**
- You're Agility-based, so roll CS d6
- Task is "Balance on narrow beam" (Average difficulty, target 4)
- You roll 5
- You succeed! (5 ≥ 4)

### Six Attributes (Pick the Right One!)

| Attribute | When to Use | Examples |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Strength** | Lifting, breaking, carrying | Break door, lift boulder, haul cargo |
| **Agility** | Balance, dodging, stealth, fine motor | Tightrope walk, pickpocket, sneak |
| **Intelligence** | Knowledge, puzzles, languages | Solve riddle, speak Elvish, decode |
| **Wisdom** | Awareness, intuition, willpower | Spot trap, read person, resist fear |
| **Charisma** | Persuasion, deception, leadership | Convince, lie, intimidate, command |
| **Constitution** | Endurance, resistance | Hold breath, resist poison, march |

### Difficulty Scale (1-6)

| Difficulty | Target Roll | Description | Examples |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Laughable** | 1 | Nearly impossible to fail | Climbing a ladder, opening unlocked door |
| **Simple** | 2 | Easy, most people succeed | Walking tightrope, basic puzzle |
| **Average** | 3 | Moderate challenge | Balancing on beam, decoding message |
| **Tough** | 4 | Challenging, requires focus | Climbing wall, convincing skeptical NPC |
| **Very Difficult** | 5 | Hard, specialists do well | Scaling sheer cliff, deceiving expert |
| **Nearly Impossible** | 6 | Nearly impossible even for experts | Climbing vertical ice, fooling judge |

### Class-Specific Rerolls (Heroic Feature)

| Class | Attribute Bonus | How It Works |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Fighter** | Strength | Reroll any Strength task once/session |
| **Cleric** | Wisdom | Reroll any Wisdom task once/session |

| **Wizard** | Intelligence | Reroll any Intelligence task once/session |

**How Rerolls Work:**
- Once per session, reroll ONE task of your class's attribute
- Reroll is used after seeing first result
- You must take the second result (can be worse!)
- Different from Heroic Reroll (which is party resource)

## 🎯 GROUP TASK RESOLUTION

### When Multiple People Attempt Same Task

**Method 1: One Person Leads**
- Leader makes the attempt
- Other characters provide support (-1 per helper)
- If leader succeeds, everyone benefits
- If leader fails, attempt fails

Example: "Fighter tries to kick down door, Cleric helps, Thief provides backup"

**Method 2: Multiple Independent Rolls**
- Each person rolls separately
- If ANY person succeeds, whole group succeeds
- Useful for: spotting trap, hearing noise, escaping
- Example: "Everyone roll Wisdom to notice the ambush"

**Method 3: First to Succeed**
- Fastest person to roll high number succeeds
- Others can help with preparation
- Example: "Who reaches the rope first?"

## 📈 CLASS-SPECIFIC REROLL ADVANTAGE

### Using Your Class Reroll

Each class gets ONE reroll per session in their primary attribute:

- **Fighter:** Strength reroll (physical tasks, breaking things)
- **Cleric:** Wisdom reroll (perception, awareness, willpower)
- **Thief:** Agility reroll (stealth, balance, precision)
- **Wizard:** Intelligence reroll (knowledge, puzzles, magic)
- **Bard:** Charisma reroll (persuasion, deception, leadership)
- **Ranger:** Wisdom reroll (tracking, perception, awareness)

### When to Use

**Good Use:** Use when you failed but have reroll available
- "I failed the Strength task to break door, but I'm a Fighter"
- "I can reroll!"
- Reroll, succeed, open door

**Bad Use:** Using reroll on non-critical task
- "I failed simple Agility task, but I'm Thief"
- "Should I reroll? No, it's laughable anyway"
- Don't waste reroll on things you'll succeed at later

**Strategic Use:** Save reroll for difficult task
- "We're trying to persuade the king"
- "I'm Bard with Charisma reroll"
- "If I fail, I use reroll!"
- Make critical persuasion attempt with safety net

## ⚠️ FAILURE CONSEQUENCES (Multiple Options)

When a task fails, PM should choose consequence that fits:

### Option 1: Simple Failure (Nothing Happens)
- You failed, but can try again later
- No penalty, just delay
- Example: "You fail to open lock, but you can try again"

### Option 2: Complication (Something Goes Wrong)
- Failure creates new problem
- Example: "You fail to pick lock quietly - guard hears and comes to investigate"

### Option 3: Harm (Take Damage/Effect)
- Failure causes damage or bad effect
- Example: "You fail to dodge trap - take 2 damage"

### Option 4: Consequence (Story Impact)
- Failure changes story going forward
- Example: "You fail to persuade guard - he refuses forever and reports you to captain"

### Option 5: Opportunity Cost (Lose Resource)
- Failure costs time, item, or resource
- Example: "You fail to climb - fall, lose expensive rope"

**PM should pick ONE consequence that makes sense for situation.**
