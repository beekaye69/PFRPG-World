# CALDRIS'S TOWER - INITIATE TEST DUNGEON
## Level 1: The Murky Forest Trial

**Dungeon Name:** The Murky Forest Trial / The Initiate's Test  
**Location:** Far eastern grounds of Archmage Caldris's Tower, deep in Murky Forest  
**Difficulty:** Medium (Levels 3-5)  
**Size:** Medium-Large (25+ distinct locations)  
**Purpose:** Magical initiate testing ground / entrance challenge dungeon  
**Connection:** Blocked passage to Level 2 at center  

---

## SECTION 1: OVERVIEW & CONTEXT

### Historical Background
The Murky Forest has always been shrouded in darkness and mystery. Caldris discovered that deep within it lies a natural cavern system, perfectly suited for testing the worthiness of magical initiates. The entrance, marked by ancient standing stones and overgrown paths, leads down into an underground complex that Caldris has modified with magical enhancements.

**Caldris's Purpose:**
- Test courage and problem-solving
- Filter out unworthy initiates
- Teach proper magical thinking
- Assess adaptability to unexpected situations
- Safe dungeon (built-in protections prevent lethal damage)

**Safety Features:**
- Magical healing stations (recharge points)
- Non-lethal encounter design (enemies pull punches)
- Magical warnings (dangers clearly marked when necessary)
- Escape passage (back to entrance, if needed)
- Recovery time allowed between encounters

---

## SECTION 2: ENTRANCE & APPROACH

### The Path Through Murky Forest

**Journey to Entrance (30+ minutes from Tower):**

The path winds through Murky Forest, increasingly dark and foreboding:
- **First mile:** Dark forest, barely visible path, unpleasant sounds
- **Second mile:** Path becomes clearer (magical markers), strange lights (will-o'-wisps)
- **Final approach:** Standing stones appear, path opens into clearing

**The Standing Stones:**

```
    [S]                [S]
              
      CLEARING
       (200ft)
    
    [S]                [S]
    
      FOREST PATH
      (entrance at bottom)
```

Five ancient standing stones (15 feet tall) mark the entrance clearing:
- **North Stone:** Carved with magical runes (glow faintly in darkness)
- **South Stone:** Crystal embedded (blue light pulsates)
- **East Stone:** Weathered, covered in moss (damp to touch)
- **West Stone:** Warm to touch (magical warmth radiates)
- **Center (implied):** Ground marked with ritual circle

**Atmosphere:**
- Perpetual twilight (sun filtered through dense canopy)
- Strange sounds (barely audible whispers, distant chiming)
- Air grows colder as you approach
- Faint magical energy perceptible to spell-casters
- Small will-o'-wisps dance at edge of perception

**Discovery Options:**
- **Careful observation:** Notice standing stones have sequence (magical clue)
- **Magic detection:** Detect strong magical aura (illusion and protection spells)
- **Perception checks:** Spot faint path leading down into earth

---

### The Entrance Chamber (Room 1)

**Size:** 60ft × 40ft × 15ft high  
**Lighting:** Magical stones embedded in walls (dim, blue-ish glow)  
**Condition:** Recently cleaned and maintained  
**Mood:** Formal, magical, slightly ominous  

**Architecture:**
- Stone floor with engraved circle in center
- Walls carved from living rock (smooth, not rough)
- Ceiling arches elegantly (carved pillars at corners)
- Alcoves along walls (6 total, empty except for magic)
- Single archway leading deeper (sealed with magical barrier)

**Key Features:**

**1. Central Circle (Ritual Array)**
- Intricate magical symbols carved into floor
- Circle of 12 points (cardinal and intercardinal directions)
- Center: Flat stone platform (3 feet diameter, raised slightly)
- **Function:** Magical binding point (prevents excessive harm to initiates)
- **Effect:** When party crosses threshold, magical contracts take effect
  - Damage above 5 HP inflicts non-lethal damage
  - Instant healing at 0 HP (but initiate "fails" dungeon)
  - Magical alarm alerts Caldris of early exit

**Discovering the Circle:**
- Obvious upon entry (carved distinctly)
- Magical aura detectable by spell-casters (abjuration)
- Cannot be bypassed (surrounds entire dungeon)

**2. Inscription on North Wall (Large, in Common)**
```
"ENTER WITH COURAGE, LEAVE WITH KNOWLEDGE
FEAR NOT FAILURE, FEAR IGNORANCE
ANSWER THE RIDDLES, PASS THE TESTS
PROVE YOURSELF WORTHY OF MAGICAL TRUTH"
```

- Carved in flowing script
- Glows faintly when magical (readiness activation)
- Written by Caldris personally

**3. Six Alcoves (Corners and Midpoints)**
- Appear empty but contain magical triggers
- **Purpose:** Store energy for healing stations throughout dungeon
- **Magical aura:** Visible to detect magic (faint)
- **No physical objects:** Pure magical constructs

**4. Archway to Main Dungeon (North Wall)**
- Stone arch (15 feet tall, carved with runes)
- Blocked by shimmering barrier (magical, not physical)
- **Appearance:** Like looking through heat haze
- **Testing:** Magical or physical damage harmless
- **Activation:** Pass ritual contract (simple: agree to terms silently)
- **Effect:** Barrier dissolves, remains open for 1 hour
  - If party leaves and returns, ceremony repeats
  - Magical alarm prevents re-entry after failure

**5. Secondary Exit (Hidden, South Wall)**
- Concealed behind loose stone (Perception DC 12 to find)
- Emergency passage back to forest surface
- Opens upward at slight incline (~50 feet to surface)
- **Purpose:** Initiate escape if too terrified to continue
- **Caldris's understanding:** Some aren't ready (no shame)
- **Mechanical effect:** Removes magical contract if used
  - No healing penalty, but "failure" logged in magical records
  - Caldris won't be angry, but initiate knows they quit

**NPCs/Encounters:**

**Magical Manifestation - Caldris's Voice**
- Not physically present, but magical projection
- Appears as glowing rune-circle at center of floor
- Speaks welcome message (10 seconds of dialogue)
- Offers single warning: "You may leave now without shame"
- Vanishes after dialogue
- **Stat Block:** Not an encounter (no combat, immobile)

**Creatures (if time passes, exploration triggers):**

**1-2 Wisp Guardians** (Magical constructs, appear if party becomes too aggressive)
- **HP:** 4 each (non-lethal mode)
- **AC:** 14
- **Damage:** 1d4 psychic (non-lethal)
- **Behavior:** Only appear if party damages dungeon/walls
- **Fight style:** Evasive, not lethal, retreat if pressed
- **Purpose:** Discourage destructive behavior

**Encounter Mechanics:**
- No mandatory combat
- Combat possible but not required
- Wisps refuse to kill (pull all attacks)
- Defeat Wisps = no penalty (just delay)
- Flee from Wisps = main path opens anyway

**Treasure/Items:**
- **None in entrance chamber** (tests don't start with rewards)

**Time to Explore:**
- Brief inspection: 5 minutes
- Full exploration: 15 minutes
