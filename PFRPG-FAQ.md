## SECTION 1: HEROIC REROLL QUESTIONS

### Q: Can I use Heroic Reroll on a Heroic Reroll?
**A:** No. Once you've expended your Heroic Reroll, it's gone for the session. You can't reroll your Heroic Reroll attempt.

---

### Q: If I have multiple Heroic Reroll sources (race + item), do I get more per session?
**A:** Yes! Each source is independent:
- Human racial: +1 per session
- Amulet of Legends: +2 per session
- Combined: +3 per session total

You spend from this pool as situations arise.

---

### Q: Can I earn Heroic Rerolls back during a session?
**A:** Yes! If you roll natural 6 → check → roll 6 again, you earn 1 Heroic Reroll. This can replenish your pool mid-session.

---

### Q: What happens if I earn a Heroic Reroll while at 0?
**A:** You gain 1 (back to 1). The pool can grow beyond starting allocation through natural 6 checks.

---

### Q: Can PM award Heroic Rerolls?
**A:** Yes. PM can reward exceptional roleplay or heroic actions with bonus reroll. This is GM discretion.

---

## SECTION 2: COMBAT & DAMAGE QUESTIONS

### Q: If I roll a 6 for damage, does it always count?
**A:** Yes. A 6 always deals 6 damage. The Natural 6 check is a bonus chance for a Heroic Reroll, not a risk.

---

### Q: Can I use Focus and Deflect in the same round?
**A:** Yes, in separate action. You attack with Focus (uses 1), then defend with Deflect (uses 1 if needed). Both can activate same round if you're being attacked and attacking.

---

### Q: What if I reach negative HP?
**A:** You hit 0 HP (unconscious). Negative isn't a state. At 0 HP you make death saves. Once you reach 0, you stay there (or heal back up).

---

### Q: Can I hit the same enemy twice in one round?
**A:** Yes, if you have 2 combat actions. Normal combat gives 1 action (1 attack or 1 defense). Some abilities grant 2 actions.

---

### Q: Does Full Defense protect against multiple attacks?
**A:** Yes. Full Defense lasts entire round. All defense rolls that round are rerolled.

---

### Q: What if I take damage while in Full Defense?
**A:** You stay in Full Defense (doesn't end). You use Full Defense reroll on that defense roll.

---

### Q: Can I move and attack in same round?
**A:** Yes. Move consumes no action. You can move, then attack (or attack, then move).

---

### Q: What if enemy disengages and I get free attack?
**A:** You get one free melee attack if they leave engagement. You can also chase (if still in movement range).

---

## SECTION 3: TASK RESOLUTION QUESTIONS

### Q: If task difficulty seems too hard, can I ask PM to lower it?
**A:** You can ask, but PM decides. Generally, difficulty is set based on situation, not negotiation. Instead, ask if you can use an ability reroll, get help from allies, or use equipment.

---

### Q: Can I retry a failed task?
**A:** Depends on task. Lock picking? Usually yes (try again). Persuading hostile NPC? Usually no (rejected, can't retry same conversation). PM discretion.

---

### Q: What if I fail an important task in exploration?
**A:** Depends on PM. Might mean:
- You don't notice the trap (takes damage when triggered)
- You can't open the chest (stays locked)
- You fall/slip (consequences as PM decides)

Failure has consequences, not always bypass.

---

### Q: Can Bard's Charming ability help with any social task?
**A:** Charming (reroll on charisma tasks) specifically helps with social influence tasks. Not all dialogue requires charisma (some require wisdom or intelligence). Use for persuasion, intimidation, seduction. Not for general conversation.

---

## SECTION 4: ABILITY QUESTIONS

### Q: Does Combat Master apply to ranged attacks?
**A:** No. Combat Master applies only to melee attacks and melee defense. Ranged attacks don't trigger it.

---

### Q: Can Backstab be used multiple times per encounter?
**A:** Yes, as long as target remains unaware. Once target aware (any combat), Backstab ends.

---

### Q: Does Flank need specific positioning?
**A:** Yes. Flank requires target to be engaged with ally in melee. If target not engaged, no Flank bonus.

---

### Q: Can Ranger's Ranged Mastery use any ranged weapon?
**A:** Yes. Sword thrown, bow, hand crossbow—any ranged attack counts.

---

### Q: Does Wizard's Brains apply to Free Form Magic?
**A:** Not automatically. Brains is reroll on intelligence tasks. Free Form Magic is a spell (not a task). PM might grant Brains reroll if Free Form Magic specifically involves intelligence problem-solving (decoding text, solving logic puzzle). Not guaranteed.

---

### Q: Can Bard sing while casting spells?
**A:** Yes. Song provides no action cost after initial setup. Bard can sing and cast spells separately.

---

## SECTION 5: MAGIC QUESTIONS

### Q: Do spells crit?
**A:** No crit mechanics in PFRPG. Natural 6 rolls trigger secondary check (chance for Heroic Reroll), but not "crit" in traditional sense.

---

### Q: Can spells be interrupted mid-cast?
**A:** Spells take 1 action to cast. Once committed, they happen. They can't be interrupted.

---

### Q: What happens if Summon Monster reaches 0 HP?
**A:** Creature disappears (destroyed). You lose the summon for that combat. Doesn't refund your spell slot.

---

### Q: Can I use Dark Bolt against invisible targets?
**A:** If you don't know where they are, no. If you know general location (rough position), you can target and hope. PM discretion.

---

### Q: Does Confusion prevent defended allies from acting?
**A:** Confusion prevents attacking/moving. It doesn't prevent defending (or other reactions).

---

### Q: If Rain of Fire affects 4 enemies, do they all roll defense?
**A:** Yes. Single spell roll, but each enemy rolls their own defense.

---

## SECTION 6: ITEM QUESTIONS

### Q: Can I wear 3 rings?
**A:** Physically yes, but only 2 provide benefits. Third ring is inert.

---

### Q: How do I choose which rings/necklaces are active?
**A:** Usually at equipping time. If all active, only 2 rings + 1 necklace work (others inert). PM might allow switching which are active between scenes.

---

### Q: Can I use Focus multiple times if I have Focus x3?
**A:** Yes. Focus x3 = 3 uses per encounter. Each encounter resets.

---

### Q: Do magical items require attunement?
**A:** Some items bond to wearer (Amulet of Legends, Amulet of the Sun God). Others can be used by anyone who equips them.

---

### Q: Can I craft magical items mid-campaign?
**A:** Yes, if you find blacksmith and have 3 Arcane Gems + base weapon/armor.

---

### Q: Does item advantage stack?
**A:** Generally no. Ring of Protection provides -1 damage (doesn't stack with other damage reduction). One primary benefit per item type.

---

## SECTION 7: MONSTER QUESTIONS

### Q: Do monsters get Heroic Rerolls?
**A:** No. Heroic Rerolls are player characters only. Monsters don't have them.

---

### Q: Can monsters use potions?
**A:** PM discretion, but typically no. Potions are player resources.

---

### Q: What CS should monster have?
**A:** Per PM assessment: weak (d6-3), average (d6-2), tough (d6-1), powerful (d6).

---

### Q: Can monsters have both Armored and Large?
**A:** Yes. Nothing prevents multiple abilities. Stacking damage reduction applies both.

---

### Q: Does Paralysis ability override Elf immunity?
**A:** No. Elf paralysis immunity is absolute (can't be paralyzed by any source).

---

## SECTION 8: PARTY COMPOSITION QUESTIONS

### Q: Can a party of all one class function?
**A:** Mechanically yes, but suboptimally. All Fighters? Works but no healing. All Wizards? Very fragile.

---

### Q: What's the minimum party size?
**A:** Mechanically, solo is possible (risky). 2+ is recommended. 4-5 is balanced for standard dungeons.

---

### Q: What if player dies?
**A:** Roll new character (PM decides whether to join mid-session or next session).

---

## SECTION 9: PM GUIDANCE QUESTIONS

### Q: How difficult should encounters be?
**A:** Easy: Party trivializes it. Moderate: Party wins with resources left. Difficult: Party wins but struggle.

---

### Q: How often should encounters happen?
**A:** Recommendation: 3-5 per session. Varies by play style.

---

### Q: Should I nerf encounters if party is losing?
**A:** PM choice. You can:
- Offer escape option
- Have enemies make tactical mistakes
- Provide environmental advantage
- Let failure happen (learning opportunity)

---

### Q: Can PM change rules mid-session?
**A:** Generally no. Consistency is important. Clarify ambiguity, don't retroactively change rules.

---

### Q: What if players disagree on rule interpretation?
**A:** PM makes final call. Note disagreement, move on, clarify for next time.

---

## SECTION 10: CHARACTER CREATION QUESTIONS

### Q: Can I choose abilities, or do class abilities determine me?
**A:** Class abilities are fixed (you get what class provides). You can't customize abilities.

---

### Q: Can I switch classes between sessions?
**A:** Typically no (breaks character continuity). PM might allow if character dies or story reason.

---

### Q: Do I start with magical items?
**A:** Typically no. You start with mundane equipment. Magical items found during play.

---

### Q: How much gold do I start with?
**A:** No starting gold (not mentioned in rules). First loot is first resources.

---

### Q: Can I homebrew a race?
**A:** Per PM discretion. Should follow PFRPG design principles (1-4 traits, no direct damage boosts, situational benefits).

---

### Q: Can I specialize in something unusual?
**A:** Per PM. Optional Specialty Task system allows non-standard focus.

---

## SECTION 11: EDGE CASES & AMBIGUITIES

### Q: If I'm in Full Defense and use Deflect, what happens?
**A:** Deflect replaces standard defense roll. Full Defense reroll doesn't apply (Deflect already committed).

---

### Q: Can I Backstab while Flanking?
**A:** No. Backstab requires surprise (unaware target). Flank requires engaged combat (aware target). Mutually exclusive.

---

### Q: What if natural 6 check also rolls 6 on the secondary roll?
**A:** Earn Heroic Reroll + original 6 benefit applies.

---

### Q: Can Bard's song affect unconscious allies?
**A:** Generally no (unconscious can't benefit from buffs). Exception: If stabilized, PM might allow healing songs.

---

### Q: If I'm hidden and attack, do I break hidden state?
**A:** Yes. Attacking breaks hidden (you're no longer hidden).

---

### Q: Can I hide mid-combat?
**A:** Generally no. Hidden requires not being in active combat. Once combat starts, hiding ends (or you left combat to hide).

---

## SECTION 12: OPTIONAL RULES CLARIFICATIONS

### Q: If PM uses optional Leveling system, how does it work?
**A:** After session, surviving characters can:
- Add 1 to max HP, OR
- Gain specialty task with reroll (new ability focus)

---

### Q: If PM uses optional Specialty Task system, how many can I have?
**A:** Per PM, but suggestion: 1-2 per character (maintains balance).

---

## SECTION 13: CLARIFICATIONS ON AMBIGUOUS RULES

### Important: PFRPG is SIMPLE
- There are no hidden modifiers
- Difficulty changes happen explicitly (PM says "that's tougher")
- No bonus stacking rules (because no bonuses exist)
- Rerolls are the primary mechanical knob

### When Rule is Ambiguous
- PM makes ruling
- Move forward
- Clarify for future sessions
- Erring toward simple is usually correct (PFRPG principle)

---

## SECTION 14: FREQUENTLY INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS

### Incorrect: "I want +2 bonus to my attack"
**Correct:** PFRPG doesn't use bonuses. You have CS (combat skill), which doesn't modify. You can affect difficulty of enemy's defense, get rerolls, or use Focus.

---

### Incorrect: "Do I get multiple attacks per turn?"
**Correct:** You get 1 action per round (attack or defense). Some abilities grant extra actions. Default: 1 action.

---

### Incorrect: "Can I stall and reroll until I win?"
**Correct:** You have 1 Heroic Reroll per session (or more if you earn them). Rerolls are limited resource.

---

### Incorrect: "Does my magic missile spell scale with level?"
**Correct:** PFRPG has no levels. Dark Bolt always does d6-2 damage (same throughout campaign).

---

### Incorrect: "Can I combine aid from Beyond + Charming + Flank to get 3 rerolls?"
**Correct:** These affect different things. Charming (charisma tasks), Flank (dual attacks), Aid (ally resource). No stacking multiplication.
