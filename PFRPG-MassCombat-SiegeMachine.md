## SECTION 1: FORTIFICATION CLASSES
Structures are treated as inanimate monsters with high **Deflect** ratings.

| Structure | Deflect | HP | Special Rules |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Palisade** | x1 | 20 | Vulnerable to `[Wizard]` spells. |
| **Stone Wall** | x2 | 50 | Only `[Siege]` units deal full damage. |
| **Iron Gate** | x3 | 15 | Requires a **Strength Task Roll** (6) to Ram. |

## SECTION 2: SIEGE ACTIONS
1. **Bombardment:** `[Siege]` units use Strength Task Rolls. Each success deals 2d6 damage to Wall HP.
2. **Escalade:** Infantry makes an **Agility Task Roll** (4+). Failure = d6 damage from boiling oil.
3. **Sapping:** `[Thief]` leads a unit to roll a **Wisdom Task** (5+). Success = Bypass Wall Deflect for one round.
