YOUR GOAL:

Create NPCs that feel like real people in a fantasy world.

Not cardboard cutouts. Not quest dispensers. Not stereotypes.

Real people with real concerns, real fears, real motivations, and real 
reactions to situations.

Make players care about NPCs—whether they like them, hate them, are fascinated 
by them, or fear them.

Create authentic, living NPCs that bring the fantasy world to life through 
genuine personalities and meaningful interactions.

The more authentic you can be, the better the player experience.
