- Worse than Fighter/Ranger (10, 10)
- Sustains moderate combat (3-4 rounds vs. d6 damage dealers)

**Positioning:** Back-to-mid-line, not front-line melee

**Defense Role:** Healing, not tanking

### Combat Skill

- Better than Bard/Wizard (d6-2)
- Worse than Fighter/Thief/Ranger (d6, d6-1, d6-1)

**Strategic Use:**

- Rolls d6-1 = 4
- Fighter healed 4 hp (back to 6 hp)

**Limitations:**
- Only 2x per encounter (resource management)
- Combat action (can't attack same turn)
- Doesn't fully heal (average 2.5 hp vs 8 hp max)

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Cleric Healing in Combat

**Setup:** Fighter at 2 hp, Cleric at 6 hp, Orc at 5 hp enemy

**Combat round:**
- Orc attacks Fighter: d6 vs. d6-1 = 5 vs. 2 → 3 damage to Fighter
- Fighter reaches -1 hp (unconscious)
- Cleric's turn: Uses Bind Wounds
- Rolls d6-1 = 4
- Fighter heals 4 hp (back to 3 hp, conscious again)
- Fighter continues combat

---

### Example 2: Righteous Insight in Exploration

**Setup:** Party in dungeon, trap room

**Scenario:**
- Cleric makes Wisdom task to notice trap (Average 4+)
- Rolls d6 = 2 (fails)
- Uses Righteous Insight reroll
- Rerolls d6 = 5 (succeeds)
- Trap detected, party avoids damage

---

## PM REASONING EXAMPLES

### PM Reasoning Example 1: "Can Cleric heal themselves with Bind Wounds?"

**Situation:**
- Cleric at 3 hp
- Uses Bind Wounds on self

**PM Reasoning:**
- Bind Wounds doesn't specify "must be ally"
- Self-healing is valid interpretation
- But strategically weak (using healing on self instead of party)

**Ruling:**
- **Allow self-healing, but note:** Wastes Cleric's role as healer
- Encourage healing allies instead
- Self-healing in emergency is acceptable

---

### PM Reasoning Example 2: "Cleric uses Holy Light to restore unconscious character to fighting shape"

**Situation:**
- Fighter at 0 hp (unconscious)
- Cleric casts Holy Light: d6-1 = 4
- Fighter restored to 4 hp (conscious again)

**PM Reasoning:**
- This is optimal Cleric play
- Holy Light brings unconscious character back
- Counts as 1 of 2 spells per encounter
- Great resource management

**Ruling:**
- **YES, this works perfectly:** Holy Light can be used on 0 HP characters
- Restores consciousness and HP
- Core Cleric strength

---

## MINI FAQ

**Q: How many times per session can I use Bind Wounds?**  
A: 2x per encounter (resets after rest/new encounter). Not limited per session.

**Q: Can Holy Light restore more than full HP?**  
A: No. Restores d6-1 hp, but can't exceed max HP (8).

**Q: If I use Righteous Insight on a non-Wisdom task, does it work?**  
A: No. Righteous Insight is specifically Wisdom reroll. Only works on Wisdom-based tasks.

**Q: Should I use Smite or Holy Light?**  
A: Holy Light (healing). Smite is rarely better (prefer other damage dealers).

---

## DECISION MATRIX: CLERIC IN COMBAT

| Situation | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Ally at 1-2 hp | Bind Wounds | Prevent 0 hp |
| Ally just reached 0 hp | Holy Light spell | Restore to fighting shape |
| No allies hurt | Attack or defend | Sustain combat |
| Low on hp yourself | Full Defense | Mitigate incoming |
| Trap/perception check | Righteous Insight | Maximize detection |

---

## OPTIMAL PLAY TACTICS

**Early Combat:** Attack/defend while allies healthy

**Mid-Combat:** Watch HP pools, heal when allies drop 30-50%

**Late-Combat:** Reactive healing based on threats

**Out-of-Combat:** Righteous Insight on perception tasks

**Party Synergy:** Works with any class; especially good with high-HP allies (Fighter, Ranger)

**Mechanics:**

**Strategic Use:**
- Protect weak allies (Wizard, Bard, Cleric)

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Fighter Using Challenge

**Setup:** Wizard in combat with 2 Goblins attacking

**Combat:**
- Goblin 1 attacks Wizard: d6-3 = 2 vs. Wizard defense d6-2 = 4 → Blocked
- Goblin 2 attacks Wizard: d6-3 = 1 vs. Wizard defense d6-2 = 3 → Blocked
- Fighter's turn: Uses Challenge on Goblin 1
- Effect: Goblin 1 must attack Fighter next turn
- Wizard now only faces Goblin 2 (safer)

---

### Example 2: Combat Master Explosion

**Setup:** Fighter vs. Boss, multiple attacks possible

**Combat:**
- Fighter attack 1 (normal): d6 = 5
- Boss defense: d6 = 2
- Damage: 5 - 2 = 3 hp
- Fighter action remaining: Use Combat Master
- Combat Master roll: d6 = 6 (natural 6!)
- Explosion chain: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16 hp additional
- Total boss damage: 3 + 16 = 19 hp (massive!)

---

## PM REASONING EXAMPLES

### PM Reasoning Example 1: "Can Fighter use Challenge on ranged enemy?"

**Situation:**
- Goblin Archer 50 feet away
- Fighter wants to Challenge them

**PM Reasoning:**
- Challenge forces enemy to focus on you
- Challenge doesn't force melee engagement
- Ranged enemy can still attack from distance
- Challenge still works (redirects attention)

**Ruling:**
- **YES, Challenge works on ranged:** Forces Archer to target Fighter (even from distance)
- Doesn't force close-range combat
- Archer can still attack from far away

---

## MINI FAQ

**Q: Can I use Combat Master on defense?**  
A: No. Combat Master is attack-only.

**Q: Does Muscle help in combat (attack rolls)?**  
A: No. Muscle is Strength-specific, not CS rolls. Use on physical tasks, not combat.

**Q: Can I Challenge the same enemy multiple times?**  
A: Yes. You can redirect them each turn, but they might resist or break free (PM discretion).

---

## OPTIMAL PLAY TACTICS

**Early Combat:** Establish dominance, use Challenge on threats

**Mid-Combat:** Maintain aggro, output damage with consistent d6 rolls

**Boss Fights:** Save Combat Master for crucial moment (when you can stack explosions)

**Party Role:** Protect weaker members via Challenge, deal reliable damage

**Synergy:** Works with any party; especially good with glass cannons (Wizard, Bard)

A: No. Backstab requires you to be hidden/unaware to enemy. Once combat starts, you're discovered.

A: No. Flank requires both Thief and ally in melee with same enemy.

**Q: Can Nimble work on combat attack rolls?**  
A: No. Nimble is Agility-specific (locks, stealth, precision). Not combat CS rolls.

---

## OPTIMAL PLAY TACTICS

**Early Combat:** Use Flank when ally engaged, output consistent damage

**Mobile Role:** Use free movement to position for Flank opportunities

---

## GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Wizard Casting Dark Bolt

**Setup:** Combat, Wizard vs. single enemy

**Combat:**
- Wizard's turn: Casts Dark Bolt (combat magic 1/2)
- Rolls CS d6-2 = 5
- Enemy defense: d6 = 2
- Damage: 5 - 2 = 3 hp
- Check for natural 6: Roll was 5 (not 6, no explosion)

---

### Example 2: Wizard Using Free Form Magic

**Setup:** Party needs to cross pit (exploration)

**Scenario:**
- Wizard wants to create bridge (out-of-combat)
- PM sets difficulty: Average (4+)
- Wizard rolls d6-2 = 4 (barely succeeds!)
- Effect: Bridge appears, party crosses safely
- Uses 1 of 2 Free Form spells

---

## PM REASONING EXAMPLES

### PM Reasoning Example 1: "Can Wizard cast a spell outside the allowed 2 per encounter?"

**Situation:**
- Wizard used both combat magic spells
- Party in tough fight
- Wizard wants to cast third spell

**PM Reasoning:**
- 2 per encounter is limit (deliberate resource constraint)
- Can't exceed limit (keeps balance)
- Encourages spell selection strategy

**Ruling:**
- **NO, 2 spell limit is hard cap:** After 2 spells per encounter, can't cast more
- Next encounter resets to 2 again
- Exception: Free Form Magic out-of-combat doesn't count toward combat limit

---

## MINI FAQ

**Q: Can I use Free Form Magic in combat?**  
A: No. Free Form Magic is out-of-combat only. Combat Magic for combat spells.

**Q: Does Brains help with combat spell rolls?**  
A: No. Brains is Intelligence-specific. Spell rolls use CS (d6-2), not Intelligence reroll.

**Q: What happens if I cast a Free Form spell and fail?**  
A: Spell slot wasted (lost for session). Effect doesn't happen. Be strategic.

---

## OPTIMAL PLAY TACTICS

**Early Combat:** Position far back, choose first spell carefully

**Spell Selection:** Dark Bolt + Confusion as flexible baseline

**Positioning:** Maximum distance from melee (safety critical)

**Exploration:** Free Form Magic for creative problem-solving

**Party Role:** Versatile control + damage, not primary attacker

**Synergy:** Works best with strong front-line (Fighter protects you)
