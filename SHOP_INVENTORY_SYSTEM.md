## 🏪 SHOP INVENTORY PHILOSOPHY

Shops are populated with **realistic, consistent inventory** that varies by settlement size and shop specialization. The LLM uses **base templates** that scale, ensuring immersion without requiring extensive detail work.

**Key Principle:** Generate inventory details **only when player looks at specific items or asks "what do you have?"** Don't pre-describe entire shop stock.

## 🎭 EXAMPLE: SHOP ENCOUNTER

**Good (On-Demand Generation):**
```
Player: "We need weapons and armor. What's the best shop in town?"

LLM: "The Ironbound Arms stands on the main street. Through the open door, 
you can see weapon racks and armor pieces on display. A weathered man in 
his fifties with burn scars on his forearms looks up from polishing a sword.

This is clearly a quality establishment - the work is professional. The 
shopkeeper has the bearing of someone who knows weapons intimately.

'Looking for something specific?' he asks, not unkindly."

Player: "I need a good sword and some leather armor."

LLM: "He sets down the sword he was polishing. 'I can help with both. For 
weapons, I have shortswords, longswords, hand axes... any preference? As for 
armor, I work with leather regularly - how much protection are you looking for?'

What's your preference?"
```

**Bad (Over-Generation):**
```
Player: "We need weapons and armor."

LLM: [Generates 50+ items, lists every weapon and armor piece in detail, 
describes entire shop layout, gives detailed background of every item...]
```
