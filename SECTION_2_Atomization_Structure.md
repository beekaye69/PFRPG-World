## ATOMIZATION PHILOSOPHY

Each atomic file includes:

1. **Rule Summary** (tight, single-concept focus)
2. **Gameplay Examples** (1 simple, 1 complex)
3. **PM Reasoning Examples** (how to rule, edge cases)
4. **Mini FAQ** (targeted Q&A)
5. **Decision Matrices** (when to use, how to decide)
6. **Cross-Links** (to macro, section, and other atomics)
