that's not theirs these days."

just say I know who in this town is dealing with things they shouldn't be."

*Player: "This ale is awful"*

wizard's business. I can make you a blade so well-balanced and sharp
that it'll feel like magic in your hands. That I can do."

*Player brings poorly-made weapon for repair*
Blacksmith: "This is garbage work. Shoddy materials, bad tempering.
Whoever made this didn't know what they were doing. I can fix it, but
