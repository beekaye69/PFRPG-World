## SECTION 1: NPC SIEGE SPECIALISTS (ENGINEERS)
Siege operations require specialists to oversee the construction and operation of heavy machinery. In PFRPG, these are treated as **Expert NPCs**.

### 1.1 The Siege Engineer
**Cost:** 250gp per month.
**Function:** For every 1 Engineer, a unit can operate 1 heavy siege engine (Catapult, Trebuchet, Ram).
**Mechanical Benefit:** - Reduces the time to build siege engines by 50%.
- Allows the use of **Intelligence Task Rolls** for Bombardment instead of Strength.

### 1.2 The Artillerist
**Cost:** 100gp per month.
**Function:** Oversees a single engine’s crew.
**Mechanical Benefit:** Grants a **Heroic Reroll** on the engine's Attack roll (once per encounter).

### 1.3 The Sapper (Miner)
**Cost:** 150gp per month.
**Function:** Specialist in undermining walls.
**Mechanical Benefit:** Essential for the **Sapping Action**. Without a Sapper, the difficulty of undermining a wall increases to **Very Difficult (6)**.

- **Requirement:** 1 Sapper + 10 Workers.

- **Duration:** Takes d6 days per success.
- **Success:** The wall’s **Deflect** rating is reduced to 0 for that section.
- **Failure:** A "Counter-mine" by the defender causes the tunnel to collapse (Unit takes 2d6 damage).

### 3.2 Escalade (Ladders/Grapples)
Standard infantry assault on walls.
- **Resolution:** **Agility Task Roll (Tough 5+)**.
- **Modifiers:** - Defensive Spikes: +1 Difficulty.
  - Boiling Oil: Unit takes 1d6 damage regardless of roll success.
- **Success:** Unit gains the parapet and initiates a Melee Clash with defenders.

### 3.3 Siege Magic Intervention
As per the *Rules Cyclopedia*, magic accelerates sieges significantly.
